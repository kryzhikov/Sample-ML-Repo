2351,ITC Grand Chola,Mr Neeraj,On the night of my arrival from NY I had a minor problem in my room. Mr Neeraj was extremely helpful in sorting out the issue immediately along with the engineering staff. His prompt service and extremely courteous manner cannot go unnoticed. Thank you Neeraj! God Bless!
2352,Hotel Pandian,,Not so great.  But it is still acceptable. Bit high for money wise.
2353,Oyo Rooms Guindy Olympia Tech Park,Nice stay for corporate people,"Been a good place to stay for people who visit Olympia Tech Park. Its a 10 minute walk to the Tech Park and the facilities are quite good. Traditional breakfast is provided and it tastes good. Airport pick up and drop services would have helped a bit but that's fine, it's easy to find the place using maps."
2354,OYO Apartments Saidapet,Average hotel,Not worth of the money we paid.worst ac.no water.no cleaning of rooms.
2355,Ramada Chennai Egmore,A good mid range corporate hotel,"A well located hotel, with decent sized rooms (bit dated decor) and good sized bathrooms and reasonable amenities.

The dinner buffet is well priced and food decent quality.

What sets this hotel out from the pack is the staff. Friendly, well trained and helpful."
2356,Mahalaya Residency,Good stay,It was a fantastic stay in the hotel. The staff was good and cooperative. The rooms were clean and maintained. The food in the restaurant was good and fresh and nicely served. Moreover it was a good experience.
2357,Savera,Wonderful stay at Savera,It's really hard to believe that now with 3-4k in hand ... You can easily get a room in a 4 star hotel that too with complimentary breakfast. All thanks to MakeMyTrip and yeah the stay was really worth every penny spent. Cheers.
2358,Lemon Tree Chennai,Average stay,"Compared to other lemon tree stay, this was bit disappointing compared to the room comfortability."
2359,Nachiappa Park,Services are worst,"One of my close friend referred this hotel and I booked it. Even after checking in our room, the room was not cleaned properly. There is no helpline numbers to contact reception, service, etc. No towels, soaps and accessories provided, after a big fight with receptionist, they provided towels and soaps after 20 mins. Worst service ever."
2360,Ramada Chennai Egmore,Not bad at all... esp. for the price.,"Pleasant stay, great breakfast too."
2361,Maurya International,June2016 in Chennai,"bkfst not so great someways was cold. Service in the restaurant poor.6TH FLOOR very noisy from the bar up above. Workers don't know how to be quite.

2362,Green Meadows,Good for stay but not more than one day,"The location good. The service good. The room good. Facilities are good Value for money. Cleanliness good.

2363,The Iris,Great experience but slow room service,"Room Service is terribly slow. For 2 bottle of water had to wait 1hr 30 mins. Lastly, when the water came it was warm, I had asked for cold. Overall, it was not a great experience. Although, buffet breakfast was good. It's a costly hotel considering room service."

There's three restaurant inside this hotel so there is plenty of variety"
2365,Mahalaya Residency,Other than proximity not is good,"Other than proximity to the airport and the room service, there's nothing to say about this place.

2367,The Spring,Not worth the money,Not worth it. The service is bad. Hotel staff are not accommodating at all. The food from the restaurants were not good and expensive. Keep this off the list!

2368,Treebo Grand Marena,Good Hotel with nice staff,"I had great stay in this hotel, this is the first place I felt people are keen and happy to serve you, with smile on their face was so genuine.

2369,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Good stay with reasonable rate,"Ideally located average hotel, cleanliness is average, small rooms, good breakfast and situated in Mount Road accessible to all city areas. Behaviour of front office staff is good and recommended for travellers to stay with reasonable rent."

2375,The Residency Chennai,,Ac is not good..bed is not that much good.. it's not worth paying. .
2376,Rivera,Old hotel & average breakfast,Hotel is old one. Bathroom is not good. This is very near to egmore station and on the main road. Beds are not good in bedroom. Complementary breakfast also average. Not worthy for the amt paid. Check same price hotels before booking.
2377,Season 4 Guest House,,Nice stay. Complementary breakfast was good. Overall experience is satisfactory.
2378,Southern Crest,Not satisfied with the stay,"I booked the room for two days, but I have got only one day occupancy, because the hotel management told me, they are already full in all rooms one week before and they informed to Makemytrip and it's Makemytrip mistake and I have lost my money for the day."

The quality of food has also gone down. We had Breakfast and Dinner at the hotel but the food was not up to the earlier standards. We regret for choosing this hotel, though we have been staying for last five years."
2382,Kek Accommodation,A stop over between Chennai and Pondicherry .,"You get what you pay for. It is very convenient for the airport. I stayed there two nights in transit to Pondicherry, the room was very basic but reasonably clean,it had hot water and free Wi Fi. The staff were very pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful. It is a defiantly a budget hotel situated in a back street in Chennai, but as long as your accept it for what it is it's ok. I would be quite happy to stay there again."
2383,Raj Park Chennai,Good but can improve,"Very good room and nice facilities, breakfast was very good feel like homely food. But the negative one is the net access, that the WiFi connection was not working there properly. Otherwise very good room and facilities."
2384,Hanu Reddy Residences Wallace Garden,Awesome Location with Great Staff,"Hotel is very nice with nice location we visited this hotel by our own vehicle, the hotel is very easy to locate as the hotel is on main road.

2405,BKR Grand,A pleasant stay,"The stay was pleasant, but the facilities that was mentioned in the website was not provided. The welcome breakfast was not given for the reason we came late, whereas it was not informed at the time of Check in about the time till which breakfast will be served. Wifi password was not given. On the whole the service was extremely poor."
2406,Manickam Grand,Ok for Family,"Good place to stay with family, no issues at all."
2407,Courtyard Chennai India,badly maintained hotel,We stayed one night at this hotel on transit from colombo to londo. the air conditioning in the whole floor and in our room was badly defective resulting in significant dampness throughout this part of the building. we felt this hotel was basically uninhabitable.
2408,Emarald,location good but room security not good,every thing is ok but hotel manegment open guest room without permission from guest in any time this is not security in hotel.
2409,Peace Inn,Nice place to stay for couple of days,"We stayed there for US Visa appointments and it was the best choice I think we made. Apart from the shabby ways, everything else was perfect. It is little inside, close to US consulate offices and marina beach. Hotel staffs were too good and helping. Overall, four out of five."
2410,VGP Golden Beach Resort,Good but needs improvement,Reception - very good. Pool - very good. Kid's area - needs maintenance. Room - very good. Bedsheets was torn. Bathroom - no soap holder. No mug/bucket. Water outlet was bad leading to water stagnant was kind of stinky at time. Open buffet - worst resort buffet ever. Restaurant - Very slow in service. No proper guidance/boards for direction.
2411,King's Cross Residency,Overall good stay,"Good location, good breakfast, good service, good hospitality had pleasure stay but only one thing a/c is working but ceiling fan is not available, surrounded smell of cigarette smoking in room. Overall good and worth of money this is the second time I could stay there."
2412,E Hotel,Comfortable and enjoyable with family,Hotel room was spacious and very large. The services offered by the hotel personnel are cordial and appreciable. Only discomfort was that the hotel was providing only vegetarian food items. However the adjoining food court in the EA mall was providing all types of food. Overall hotel stay was enjoyable
2413,"Radisson Chennai City Centre, India",Amazing stay,"In just few word, its worth money, absolutely amazing stay, staff will make all possibility to make your stay memorable. I had amazing stay.. It in my favourite list, & I make sure to repeat stay again soon."
2414,Gokulam Park Sabari OMR,Awesome experience,Had good stay. The front desk executives were very supportive and polite and went extra mile to bring smiles. I would also like to appreciate Manju for her support. Rooms were spacious and amibience was excellent. It's more than value for money.
2415,Sathyam Grand Resorts,An average place to stay,Hospitality is lacking. Front desk in-charge wanted to check the online payment (made through Makemytrip). In-fact he does not approve the discount offered to me by Makemytrip initially. Then I made him understand about the deal. This is not the way a customer is treated in any hotel.
2416,Raj Residency,Ok but no response in front office person he is rough,Super nice i like that hotel oooooooooknnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnjdjjsshdbdbdbdnndndndjdjdjdjdjdjdkdkrrkkdkdkdkdndmdndndndndjfjfjjtjrjddjnsmsksksjdjdjdjdndndndnffnfjjdjdjdndndjdjduensjeudjsidndndmmfmfndnfndnndjekdkejdkkskskkdkskdhfnjdrjjdjdjjdkskzjdhjdjdjdjejdjjd
2417,Dee Cee Manor,Worst room and waste of money,"I paid for 3 nights from 15th June to 18th June 2016 but I didn't stayed single day. Already raised complaint to make my trip. And I told make my trip CSE to cancel it but CSE says no refund. So I booked another hotel near Thoraipakkam. Too worst room I never seen before in my life, toilet is too worst unclean, no door lock, no privacy, worst room service, worst front office behaviours."
2418,Hanu Reddy Residences Poes Garden,Best hotel in the surrounding,"This property is located close to the Tamil Nadu CM and Thalaivar Rajinikanth's house and you can expect tight security. Safe, silent and lots trees around away from the traffic noise. Rooms are very clean and has good facilities and hotel staff were also very courteous. Only let down for me would be the food can do better."
2419,Royal Star,Hotel is not good as per cost,Hotel location is near to Chennai Central Railway Station up to 1 km. Front office staff behaviour is not good. I am always book hotels through Makemytrip and any hotel didn't want to print out hotel voucher but this hotel told us if you will give print out of booking voucher we will charge as per our tariff. Food quality is also not good. Same day laundry facility is not available at this hotel.
2420,The Residency Chennai,Awesome & luxurious hotel to stay,The ambiance of hotel was very good. It was an awesome hotel and also very awesome service provided by the hotel. The staff were courteous and the room was indeed very nice. Spacious rooms. Outer design and as well as inner design was very good. The entrance gate and front office I like the most. Good behavior of hotel staff. World class facility with luxurious hotel.
2421,E Hotel,Good location and spacious rooms,"Overall, good experience. +ves: * Located inside a mall. Convenient location. * Big rooms. * Helpful friendly staff, though the guy at reception was cold but I would not let that cloud my overall good experience with the hotel staff. -ves: * Weird policy of limiting internet to only two devices per room. * No baby chair in restaurant."
2422,Taj Club House,Valet Parking & Vegan Food,"Valet parking: the ac control switch near driver's seat was broken hence self parking & having the car keys with the guests is recommended
Vegan food: their is no specific menu for vegan, in vegetarian 1 or 2 items are only vegan. Hence would not recommend breakfast here for vegans"
2423,Annsun Boutique,Good hotel at a good atmosphere,The hotel is in domestic atmosphere. The amenities is good. The behaviour of staff is good. The food provided is good. The location of hotel is away from market or mall so if one who desirous to purchase some thing is very difficult. But the stay at this hotel is peaceful and comfortable. The tourist with family can stay without any difficulty.
2424,Treebo Grand Marena,Hotel is fine !,The location of hotel is inside a colony and difficult to access without a vehicle. The breakfast provided by them is also disappointing.
2425,Sea Shore Inn,Very spacious rooms,"Well equipped, very spacious rooms. Very much upgraded. Hospitality is too good. Located near beach. Providing very scenic view. Also close to the temple. Early in the morning we could view the sunrise from our room. Which was a very soothing experience. Maintenance needs to be improved. As it is close to the beach. Also corrosive sea breeze has damaged the mirror. Overall excluding these minor things. We had a great stay with wonderful view."
2426,Emarald,Easy to locate place,"My trip to Chennai started here as it is very nearer to Chennai central railway station.. Location is good easy to reach.. Rooms are OK but small.. Complimentary breakfast, lunch everything is so tasty.. But only problem is with the size of the room..."
2427,Feathers- A Radha S,Business trip,"Hotel is very recent. Facilities are good. Service is ok. Nothing to do outside the hotel, just one Catholic Church on the opposite road. 
Price is far for what you get in room and food. Beverage a little high price."
2428,The Spin,Pleasant and good stay,"Pleasant and good stay, good food, hotel manager upgraded my room, good location to my work. And also not far to T, G. Nagar. Will stay again for my next trip to Chennai. One comment they need to improve the toilet shower in the Executive Room. It is very old and not working properly."
2429,Park Hyatt,,Nice stay..very good service...especially the person named mr. dinesh who is in reception assisted me a lot.such a good person in the hotel..he assisted me till the period of vacate..very good person..
2430,"The Raintree, St. Mary's Road",Just Lovely!,Great location with airport transport. Breakfast was bountiful! Rooms were clean and spacious with Mini bar coffee maker and hair dryer. Roof top pool resteraunt and bar were amazing with a Daily Happy Hour! aC and Wifi!
2431,Savera,A decent hotel with good service,The hotel is clean and comfortable with a wide choice of food in its three restaurants. Staff are courteous and friendly. There is a very efficient travel desk. My request for late checkout was accommodated readily but the amount charged for a 4 hour over stay beyond their usual allowance of 2 hours was a little pinching when compared to the rate I paid for my 2 nights stay through Make My Trip.
2432,Treebo Hive,Neat hotel and good atmosphere,It was a nice experience for staying in this hotel. And the management was very good and the room was very well-maintained. The food was very tasty and delicious and excellent desserts. Very pleasant atmosphere in the rooms and the best for staying in Chennai.
2433,Quality Inn Airport,Excellent airport hotel.,Convenient location and good service. Hotel for airport is adequate and comfort is above average if compared with other mid-ranged airport hotels around the world. They offer frequent and reliable airport pick up and drop off service which I found very useful.

2437,Buhari Royale,Surprisingly Splendid Hotel,"We were pleasantly surprised to find this special hotel in the busy urban environment of Chennai. The staff were extremely attentive, assisting with luggage, answering questions, responding to concerns, etc. The hotel is also located very close to the airport, only about 2 km away, which was convenient in catching my flight out of India in a timely, relaxed manner."
2438,ITC Grand Chola,Overly hyped,"I heard a lot about chola, but I found not to my expectation. Highly priced rooms, over priced food, and full of false pride staff. I think, I don't need two hundred words to describe Chola. Whatever I have written should be enough to understand hotel management."
2439,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Deba Mishra,Nice Hotel as located in main biz Dist) which saves local conveyence with lively bar. Rooms are worth of money paid with complimentary breakfast ... Above all allows 24hr check in and out
2440,The Royal Regency,Hotel location is very good and sarvice is very good,Hotel facilities is very good and sarvice is very good and location is very good and restaurants sarvice is very good and food is very good food like and testi and hotel sarvice is very good hotel facilities is very good so hotel is good
2441,The Iris,Bad experience,"Congested rooms, absolutely poor service even at the reception. Overall not worth the money and it was evident that management is negligent about their reputation. Not properly organized and made us wait for half an hour for room keys in spite of having booked in advance. Overall it was a bad experience."
2442,Le Royal M?ridien Chennai,Centrally located and delicious breakfast,It was nice experience of stay in hotel. Hotel is located at the heart of the city. Very close to the railway station and bus stand so it will save time & money. Complementary breakfast was delicious. Recommended for stay for business /leisure / to see the city.
2443,E Hotel,Pleasant stay,Quiet hotel in the middle of town. Very convenient. Neat and tidy. Laid back. Service takes slightly longer than one expects. Not too much choice on the variety of food. Overall a pleasant and happy experience.
2444,Fortune Select Palms,Great place for staying with neat room,"It was very nice movement for staying at this hotel, the hotel was very nice as well the management, they received very well. After that we had great dinner and it was very nice food. The room was very neatly maintained and the atmosphere also very nice in the room. It was very nice experience."
2445,The Iris,Awesome cleanliness but poor room services,Cleanliness is awesome. Extra beds are overpriced. Staff is not willing to adjust check-in and checkout times despite telling them in the extras at the time of booking the hotel. The room service is also poor. I asked them to get 2 water bottles. They took nearly 30 mins and got only 1.
2446,The Park Chennai,"Great location for business, but cramped",This place is probably better for business travelers but its definitely cramped for families. The bathrooms were very small and i felt I like was in a plane toilet. The location is outstanding though and accessible to almost everything in mainland chennai.
2447,Season 4 Guest House,,hand a wonderful time
2448,The Residency Towers,Hotel review,Complimentary breakfast was given by the hotel. The hotel was good. There was no delay in check in and checkout at the hotel. I was satisfied with this hotel stay. I didn’t use activity in the hotel.
2449,Aloft Chennai Omr - It Expressway,Good room & amazing food,"I stayed for a day in aloft and the food was amazing.. Liked the room as well but could have been better as it was short of pillows and towels. All the other basic amenities are present and would give 4 star for the food alone and 3 star for the overall, experience."
2450,The Royal Regency,Decent hotel & value for money,"Very near to central and Egmore stations, it's value for money, it's worth for the amount, hotel was decent. A approachable to all near places, the food was OK, AC was working properly, Chennai always the climate would be humid kind off, but it was pleasant during my stay."
2451,Apple Residency,Budget but excellent,"They are service and room cleaning good. Food is excellent and restaurant manager Simbu, he is very kind and all the staff very helpful. I should mention the food they are making biryani it is really excellent but they are not providing complimentary water bottle. Apart from that everything is good. Main plus point is near the Marina Beach. Overall excellent stay."
2452,Accord Metropolitan,Friendly Staff,We had a pleasant stay there. The staff were very friendly. Don't rent a cab from them as they charge lot more than other regular service providers.

2456,Star City Serviced Apartments,Very Poor facilities for the charges paid,"There is no restaurant, they are giving a standard breakfast from a hotel with out any heat not even a coffee, very poor facilities. The AC reomte was not given so I have to switch off the AC because it was so cool just directly above your bed a capsule AC. No fan"
2457,Hilton Chennai,"Good experience, will visit again",The appearance of the hotel was good. The food was good with quality and quantity. The hotel was located inside the city. I had visited this hotel for official trip. The service was very good. There were activities arranged by this hotel.
2458,Sheraton Park Hotel & Towers,Crowne Plaza Chennai,Good service from staff throughout.
2459,Taj Club House,,Taj quality is unparalleled. Attention to details makes the difference.
2460,The Checkers,Nice hotel to stay,We enjoyed stay with family in this hotel. This hotel is best value for money & in facilities. Breakfast was too awesome. Cleanliness if this hotel was great. No dirt. Very maintain hotel in Chennai..
2461,Park Hyatt,Best of the best hotel,Park Hyatt really lived to the hype. The best part of this hotel is the bathroom and roof top swimming pool which gives you a great view of Chennai. Their flagship pub Flying Elephants is really happening on the weekends and as a staying guess you get a free entry to one of the most exciting pubs. The service and ambience of this hotel was top notch and unparalleled.
2462,Sathyam Grand Resorts,"Good, but not so good for a Club Premium room","Buffet breakfast is excellent and room is good, but not so good for a Club Premium room. Children enjoyed in the swimming pool and as there is no Mosquitoes we had a good sleep. Overall nice for one day outing with family. There is a leakage in the tap water, so expecting more cleanliness in the toilet and bedsheets."
2463,The Park Chennai,Very dirty rooms,As soon as we entered the room our first thought was not to touch anything as it was very dirty. room was worse then a cheap motel room and you wouldn't want to get close to the bed. This is definitely not a 5* hotel as mentioned on Expedia. Its close to US consulate but with rooms so bad I would rather travel a few minutes then stay here.
2464,Ammu Palace,Terrrible,Checked out in 30min. Because bad service.
2465,"Radisson Chennai City Centre, India",,"The additional bed provided was a disgrace
Did not provide the required sheets or additional towels paid for"
2466,Surya Prakesh,hospital,"i stayed there many times, always loved doing so,though the lack of room service recognition has disappointed me. it is still one of the great hotel in anthapuram. it is very near to the shankar nethralaya . the surroundings also nice the way of reeving and food allotment also very good. we have spent many stays at this hotel and each visit has been exemplary over a number ofyears."
2467,The Centre Point,Good,"Good location. Courteous staff. Good room service. Small room. Hotel under renovation. The hotel itself is a small building. Parking facilities are limited. Overall very friendly and polite staff. Was impressed with the food ordered from service. It is ideal for business travellers, not so much for families."
2468,Lemon Tree Chennai,Overnight stay for airport connection,"Good hotel and room. Not too far from the airport - about 15 mins. Helpful staff, restaurant maybe overpriced but not bad. Bed was comfortable and clean. Free WiFi wasn't really good. Overall quite satisfied."

2495,Treebo J's Five Two Boutique,Facilities & Room service are not good,Facilities & Room services are Below Average. Man power are very less. Room service are Soo much of time consuming. Network issues. WiFi not working properly
2496,Grand Treat,,Communication with the staff was very difficult as they spoke minimal English. They seemed to be unaware they took bookings through Expedia so even though we had already paid they knew nothing about the booking. We almost missed our plane as although we had asked for a large taxi a small one turned up that refused to take us. The room we finally got was a good size but had cockroach's.
2497,Aloft Chennai Omr - It Expressway,Get the basics right!,"I always overlooked the funky lightings and the offbeat decor but one thing I can't get used to is the room itself. No storage space for clothes, odd shape of the room,the ac location which makes the room too cold or too hot and very ordinary service at the restaurant just makes it a bad place for business travellers."

Best and worth for the price. Rooms are very clean and classically decorated. Food also good. Housekeeping were very friendly and helpful. Room cleaning was beyond my expectation. Impeccable clean bathrooms. It would be my favourite in future trips also.
2502,Redsun Serviced Apartments,It was an average service apartment,"Me and my team visited this apartment because of Official trainings in many companies. Apartment is located near by many IT companies. Rooms are big enough to stay, but cleanness and neatness is average. Kitchen is not clean.

2509,Golden Fruits Business Suites - T Nagar,Reasonably priced Business Hotel,Comfortable reconditioned rooms with shower chamber. Centrally located. Breakfast is average. Taxi and auto easily available. 10 km 1/2 hour drive from airport. T nagar market with major shopping malls is nearby. Krishna sweets. More outlet and Sarvana Bhawan are also closeby at walking distance.
2510,Goldmine,Worst hotel experience ever,Checked in for a night. Both of us got itching all over the body and then we called room service for a fresh bed cover. They said they are coming in few minutes but no one came or returned the call. I had to call again after 15 minutes for them to deliver bed sheets which were mildly wet.
2511,Savera,Old hotel who know how to treat their guests,"The Savera Hotel is an oldie but a goody. They have been in the luxury hotel business for 50+ years and are very good at what they do. The hotel is furnished really well, the breakfast buffet is scrumptious, the location is good (central but fairly quiet). The staff are really courteous and friendly and everything worked just fine."
2512,Southern Crest,Good for stay with family,The hotel was good for a family stay. The location is good and T. Nagar market is walkable. T. Nagar is a busy business place with a lot of things. Shopping enthusiasts would like the place. Autos and other public transport is easily available to all the parts of the city.
2513,Hablis Chennai,Feedback,"Above average

Morning buffet was averge for 5 star hotel. 

Smoking smell thru out the corridor."

2515,Maple Tree,,They told me this Booking is not valid and they don't have a tie up with Hotels.
2516,Southern Crest,Impeccable service,"Impeccable service !. The bathroom towels were not very clean. Hot water supply was erratic but not a great issue. Too tiny a bar that they had, dim lit. Reception was in 2nd floor is a dampener. Food was okay."
2517,OMR Guest House,Average stay,Average stay. Easy accessible location in omr. Rooms were in OK condition. Facilities were fine. Rate was little high compared to other same type hotels near by. Prefer to take this hotel again as it is easily accessible.

2519,Marina Inn,,it was very comfortable an enjoyed.
2520,Hilton Chennai,Good for business stay,"Good central for business trips. A little on the higher side for the location. Rooms are tidy and new. Noise level is low, staff is friendly, Gym trainer is extra friendly. The new metro station has ruined the look from the front, but has aided connectivity."
2521,Accord Metropolitan,No value for money,Table and chair not clean. Not value for money. PC lan cable has so much dust but WiFi Internet speed is too good. Bar service is too bad only one waiter serving to all customer. Serving food like tandoori chicken is very salty.
2522,Redsun Serviced Apartments,Good place for short stay,The place is located in pallikaranai opposite to balaji dental college and hospital. Pretty accessible. I stayed for a day with my wife as I had a marriage party to attend later in the day. There is nothing much to do in the flat we rented except watching TV and cozying on the couch. Other than that the food was OK.
2523,Suvi Annexure,Not for us....,As most people do we used this hotel for a 1 night stopover but it was not so nice for us. It is basic which is fine but it was also dirty and noisy. The shower was more of a drip and the staff are very persistent when waiting for their tips! On a postive note they did collect us and drop us at the airport but I would probably rather stay in the airport rather than this hotel.
2524,Akash Inn,Not a good hotel,The location was good as it was in front of our conference venue. But services were not satisfactory for value of money. Air conditioner was noisy could not even sleep at night. Even after complaining it was not repaired till we checked out. I was not satisfied with the services.
2525,E Hotel,A great place to stay,"I keep coming here, it's a great place to stay at Chennai, but I always find if their customer care are more focussed they can get more out of a regular visitor. I tried connecting with them many time, but they don't offer comprehensive package to suit individual request. Any way, it's like choose your own, and I would be doing so till the time I don't look out of options around."
2526,Hanu Reddy Residences Wallace Garden,Good value for money stay,"Generally good with courteous and helpful staff. However the bathroom sink was cracked. Also the water supply ran out on our penultimate day, though it was restored within half an hour of our complaint. The food cooked to order was simple and excellent as was the included breakfast. Overall, I would rate the place favourably."
2527,The Raintree,,Good
2528,Keys Hotel Katti-Ma,Good value hotel in Adyar,"This nice little hotel is very close to Adyar, Thiruvanmiyur and the IT highway. The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms clean. Wifi was patchy in my room but not in my friend's, so it varies. The staff are extremely helpful and very friendly. I'll stay there again."
2529,Hanu Reddy Residences Poes Garden,A bit old property but well-managed,"The property is located in most posh part of the city, and has quaint homely feel. The staff is super efficient and available round the clock. Although, a bit old property, well-managed and upkeep as per best standards."

2533,Treebo Grand Marena,Good stay with good service,"Though a business trip, it was good stay but I do hope it improves in due course of time. Since being single I might not have enjoyed the amenities but I do hope to visit next time with a friend or my family. I thank them for providing room service and good housekeeping services."
2534,The Chariot,Bad experience and zero value for money,"I reached the hotel in the early morning by 6, since it was a 24-hr check-out, they asked to check out by 6 next day. A grace time of even 2 hrs (till 8) was not given as well. Floors are dirty, towels unusable, no toiletries, CRT TV that too with no Hindi/English channels working and then they call themselves a 3-star hotel."
2535,Lake View Park,Excellent room service & budget hotel,"Reasonable budget hotels in centre location. Small rooms, but neat and clean. Excellent room service. Reception was good. Good transportation facilities. Easy landmark. Wish to stay in next visit also. Best shopping location and lot of eateries near by."

2537,The Pride,Excellent Hotel!!,"Excellent hotel in chennai. And the staff are really good and they were able to allow an early check-in and late check-out. everything was excellent except for the bar which was horrible and not well stocked, bar tender had no knowledge bout drinks. But the others things made up for it.
This is an awesome hotel"
2538,Savera,Wonderful stay at Savera,It's really hard to believe that now with 3-4k in hand ... You can easily get a room in a 4 star hotel that too with complimentary breakfast. All thanks to MakeMyTrip and yeah the stay was really worth every penny spent. Cheers.
2539,Tri Sea Residency,Very good hotel for staying,"It is very good hotel for staying in Marina Beach area. Food also available but little bit costly, very near from Chennai central railway station, walk able distance to marina beach. Overall it is good."
2540,Regency Royal Paris,Pleasant stay,"Stay is good, pleasant and food also not bad. Very near to central railway station."
2541,Southern Crest,Overall value for money,Hotel is just beside Pondy Bazaar and in heart of T Nagar. That's a great plus. Breakfast spread is good. But dinner spread and taste is average. On cleanliness the hotel needs more improvement. Rooms are spacious.
2542,Treebo Nestlay Casa,So-so,"The room was okay, but I was disappointed in the service. The desk managers were less-than-happy to help out with such small matters as calling a cab, and in fact did not know the area well. One of them (the younger one) had a habitual response to all my queries: \""No\"" or \""I don't know.\"" It looks like a matter of poor training, something I've noticed at other Treebo hotels. Treebo needs to attend to this."
2543,Taj Club House,"Close to 2 shopping centres, nice and quiet","Service minded staff, who attended to the residents’ requirements in a professional and courteous manner. Buffet breakfast was excellent with a variety that suits both Westerners and Indians. We tried vegetarian curries and Nan breads in ‘Beyond Indus restaurant’ on a number of occasions and must admit that the quality and freshness was superb."
2544,Park Hyatt,Excellent hotel with wonderful facilities,"Great ambience, good staff, wonderful food, big rooms. Accessibility to Airport, nice location and all at reasonable price. Mine was a short but comfortable stay. Overall, 5 star stay. Recommended for future stay in Chennai."
2545,Aryaas,Good service with good food,"First class Indian recipes. Veg items are really good. Service are neat, clean etc. Very nice. Food items supplied good. And nice experience with them. Always I would like to have food in different hotels. I would like good food, I don't mind about hotels and what ever it is. But overall experience is fine with Aryaas."
2546,Sai International,Very Okay ! Can be better,"Had Booked this hotel for 01 Night which was unavoidable. Booked it because it is right in the centre of T-Nagar. Rooms were okay! not recommended for couples, bathrooms are stinky, towels are smelly. staff is courteous but the rooms are just OKAY !"
2547,Southern Crest,The short stay,"It was a good location, hotel not that well known with auto & taxi but the room was clean and comfortable, AC was good only the WiFi was always intermittent. Staffs were responsive and helpful. Would consider staying there again. Overall a comfortable stay."
2548,"The Raintree, St. Mary's Road",just like home,i work all over the world and hotels are part of my life the Raintree St. Marys is absolutely wonderful the staff from top management to resteraunt staff and housekeeping are very friendly and accomadating they make you feel at home but with better service :) definitley recomend this place for business or vacation . the location is great and they have three resteraunts all with great food
2549,New Woodlands,Big hotel with good swimming pool,"I was going to Chennai at last month for some work & visiting Chennai. Me & my sir stayed at hotel New Woodland. It is a big hotel. They have good swimming pool. We stayed here four days. I was enjoyed at Chennai. Like Gandhi sea beach, Merina sea beach, Golden sea beach & Chennai city centre."
2550,Marina Inn,"Average hotel, indifferent staff at reception","Hotel was decent enough although room was disappointing compared with the lobby and restaurant area. The bar and staff in the basement was good and hotel was in a convenient location. We selected a different hotel when we came back to Chennai mainly because of the reception staff who didn't want to help us get some change for the tuk tuk when we arrived, or help us with onward transportation."

2554,Peace Inn,Nice hotel,Never came across any issues in this hotel. simply best...
2555,Goutham Manor,Poor experience,"Not worth the money. One of the worst stay I ever had. Please avoid this hotel rooms. Please find some other place to stay. I don't think it deserves that much cost. But one thing in favor of this hotel is the location where you got all the access around like chetpet railway station, krm plaza, etc."
2556,The Pride,Will not stay again!,"Took an hour to find this hotel. It is away from the main street, but loved the view from our room. We arrived around 10pm after almost 8 hours of drive from Chennai. All we wanted was a good, hot shower but to our dismay the hot shower was not working. They took 2 hours to get that repaired. The staff were trying their best, but its just that we were so frustrated!"
2557,Metropark - Vadapalani,Clean room and value for money,"Clean and value for money. Right in the middle of 100 feet road, busy but hotel is new and clean. If you get a relatively new hotel you will get clean room. Will recommend the hotel to short stay couples. Vijaya Mall is nearby too, get a relief at the mall."
2558,Gokulam Park Sabari OMR,Good business class hotel,"I was searching for an affordable hotel near to Ottiyambakkam for a Triathlon event organized by CTC. MakeMyTrip gave me a good deal and I loved the stay. Easy to locate the hotel as it is in OMR road. Clean and peaceful, loved the food at the restaurant after my event.

I have stayed there for 3 days and all the three days has been a good experience for me. Very wonderful stay in Aloft.

2570,Metropark - Vadapalani,Nightmare,Worst hotel and worst location. Room doesn't worth for the money we pay. Smallest room I have ever seen in hotel. If would have rated this hotel total negative if I had a chance
2571,Benzz Park,good hotel bad service,The stay was good but had to follow up multiple times for getting the room service. Even after calling 3 times I did not get the same.
2572,The Park Chennai,Good place to stay,"Overall a good place to stay. Food was good. Rooms were clean and have enough space. Best place for visa interview as the place is right opposite and in case you forgot something for visa, you can get it quickly from room."
2573,FabHotel Blossoms T Nagar,Located in the heart of the city,I have stayed there on a business visit. The first thing is the location of the apartments. It is in the heart of the city. (T. Nagar).

2579,Aloft Chennai Omr - It Expressway,happy,was really good :)
2580,Peace Inn,Rooms well-maintained and helpful staff,"Spent two nights in this Hotel in September, 2014. The room was clean and tidy, clean bathroom and aircon worked. Staff at this hotel were very helpful and the driver they arranged for a day trip was excellent. A nice cool clean haven to come back to after tramping around the streets of Chennai."
2581,Maurya International,Free tiffin should be advanced!,The hotel WiFi facility is very bad. It is only namesake. What ever message I sent all not gone using lesser capacity. Free offer timings at 7. 30am is not correct. At least coffee should have given those only want that if tiffin could not be given ear.
2582,Radha Regent,Excellent hotel,The hotel facilities are really good.The buffet breakfast is really taste and good varieties.
2583,King's Cross Residency,Value for Money,"I stayed 2 days in this hotel. Staff is very friendly and talking politely. Complimentary breakfast is ok. Car parking has very limited space.

2586,Turyaa Chennai,Nice place to stay for business,"I am basically travelling all over india and come to Chennai regularly, usually I stay in Lemon Tree and to be honest, Lemon Tree is not worth that money, so I tried this new hotel which is near my friend's flat, it is quite Clean, fruits are good quality, service is fast and nice. Hotel is full of modern, fashion and comfortable."
2587,Raj Palace Hotel,Bad experience,I suggest to everyone never ever go here. The pics of good hotel and good rooms but gave room in a guest house rooms like servant quarter very bad staff. They fights with a customers. Never ever go to this hotel.
2588,Glm Meridian,Good!!!,Room was comfortable and spacious. Amenities were good.Close to the biggest shopping spot in Chennai.
2589,Lemon Tree Chennai,Horrible experience,The size of the bed is so small that a single person is uncomfortable to sleep. They sell the same bed on double occupancy. Difficult to imagine how two persons can fit on the bed. Washrooms are so small. One can barely move around. Breakfast truly is free. Not complimentary. Food was absolutely not having any taste. Totally waste of money and uncomfortable night.
2590,Treebo Nestlay Airport,,Overall hotel room is good within the budget and near to airport.
2591,Esthell,Not very happy,"The food and services in the hotel can improve substantially. The rooms though clean and well maintained are a little cramped. Running hot water is not available and this causes difficulty to people like me who like to take Bath before going to bed. Beside the non-availability, hot water when available is rationed and not adequate for a comfortable Bath."

2602,Samudra Residency,An average place to stay near Railway station,Its an average hotel. So if you are looking for business trip. Its OK. I paid rs 620 and I feel its worth the money.

2604,The Park Chennai,Average stay,"While the location, room, facilities are good. There is lot to be improved on service levels especially at the time of check-in and checkout. The staff at the reception counter possibly are not trained well or there is too much of attrition of trained staff. Wait for checkin/checkout is too long and not acceptable from a star category hotel."
2605,Accord Metropolitan,Good for business travel.,Excellent staff.very friendly&helpful.however timetaken to resond was poor.breakfast menu could be better.daily toiletry &towel replenishment insufficient.but overal stay was pleasant.

2614,The Park Chennai,Food tasted awful,"Except for being in the heart of city the hotel has nothing to boast of. Food tasted awful so much so, that we almost ate with pickle as a side dish. Breakfast room is poorly lit is enough to make your morning dull. Rooms unkempt and falling apart."
2615,The Raintree,nice hotel with costly add ons,"Hotel room is great, and the staff are very helpful. Located on Anna Salai, So forget taking a walk to get to nearby places. Add ons like lunch/dinner buffet costs too much- but this is expected. One thing I did not like is the presence of too many staffs and the  'vanakkam' they perform at the front door-I did not need that every time I come in- just a smile would have been enough. But the hotel as such no complaints."
2616,Star City Serviced Apartments,Never stay here,"Absolutely pathetic. Photos shown on the net are fake and the property is nowhere closer to it. There is no Reception at all! No room service, no laundry service, not even telephone set in the room. Mentioned a 3 Star on the site but giving 1 Star would be an insult to Star Category. Never never go there."

2623,Savera,Nice stay and good services,"I liked the hotel, people are very nice, good service. But the room in which I was staying 411 would have smoking smell though it was a non smoking room.

2624,Tri Sea Residency,Decent stay,"The front office Air-conditioner was not working, the seats in the lounge were torn and shabby.

The restaurants serve good food. The breakfast was also good."

2635,Mount Heera,Worst hotel in Chennai,"I haven't seen such worst hotel in my life. The staff behavior is rude.

Food is worst but room cleanliness is not good."
2636,Hilton Chennai,A relaxing Break from the streets of Chennai,"The Hilton Chennai, is a lovely hotel with very kind staff and extremely clean and relaxing rooms. Q-bar on the roof is always hopping on Friday and Saturday nights and the food at the restaurant or room service will help any western travelers belly from getting delhi belly.

Facilities are great. Food is overpriced."
2809,Mount Heera,Not a good experience,"Not a good experience. Hotel is not clean. Manager was too rude, not supporting nature. Breakfast is pretty much good.

2817,Savera,Value for money,"Room was very neat and clean. Business Standard room was quiet spacious. Very good buffet breakfast.

It was near to Embassy so easy to move around. Service was good. I would suggest this hotel to others. It was value for money."
2818,My Fortune Chennai,Good facility with room for improvement,"My stay at the hotel was good as far as location is concerned. What I feel was that there should be reorganization needed at the reception area. There should be good ample seating facility available for the just arrived customers. Pool side, though small area, may be opened for customer which wasn't at my stay. It must not be kept for show piece rather it should be allowed for users i.e guests. Beside this, the service and food were very good."
2819,Savera,Bad experience,"The hotel looked pretty decent from outside. However, the hallway was smelly and dirty. Room was smelling and very stuff. Bathroom was not clean and felt very suffocating.

Hence they were gracious enough to offer free breakfast for my family of 3 (which runs about US$ 25) for free."
2824,Radisson Blu GRT Chennai,Nice accommodation with excellent hospitality,Excellent experience starting from the pickup at Airport to drop at Airport.

And if I will come in this city so I will stay here only

2955,Treebo Hive,Decent Place,"Trivago listed the hotel as near to MEPZ but it was actually ~20kms away.  But no complaints. it took us only 45 min in peak hours and 30 min in non-peak to and fro office.

Good overall experience. There is no lift and that's a big dampener. Good Wi-Fi connection and hassle-free too. Good Food.

2993,Marina Inn,Cockroach infestation needs to be addressed,"The hotel is at a convenient location and the rooms are pretty spacious and comfortable, the staff is courteous too. But the rooms have a terrible cockroach infestation, they were in the cupboard, bathroom, on the bed and tables.

It has got food facility also and the staff takes utmost care to attend the individual needs. The management is keen to take feedback from guests to enhance their service.

The hotel has its own quirks, like no wifi after 11~11:30pm... and back on at morning 6 or 7... that might put off some people, especially business and data bingers... Also, the wifi reception inside the room was spotty and the internet slow... all these are fixable should the people who run the hotel want to. 

Apart from that, the stay was nice and comfortable, the staff was polite and helpful."

As it is serviced apartment doesn't have amenities, but a very nice hotel to stay for either business or family.."
3032,Nachiappa Park,Good location and decent rooms,"We stayed here for two nights. The hotel lies in what you can call the business area, which means the price will not be the lowest but it is very convenient since many restaurants are around. There was friendly staff and decent rooms. The only real downside was that we had no view at all (ie. A brick wall)."
3033,Pratap Plaza,Breakfast was good,Room Size is too small... The accessibility was bit of an issue. In general it is OK for a short stay. Have stayed multiple hotels in the same area and they are comparatively spacious compared to this.
3034,The Lotus  Sameera,,"Property is more of a apart-hotel than actually a hotel; being newly done it's quite clean and tidy. But no facilities of a hotel should be expected like there is no lounge, lobby, coffee shop, etc. Only a mini-restaurant to cater to the breakfast."
3035,Gokulam Park,Worst experience,"Please ignore this. They are do many options in this city. Poor service, poor maintenance, no TV channels, no response on your requests. Absolute waste of money. Just for location close to airport and very easily located... Nothing else I mean.."

Only Service was good."
3041,Hyatt Regency Chennai,Dissappointed,"The linens were smelling bad, and the elevators had a pungent odour. The housekeeping was not up to par of a 5 star hotel. They didn't clean the rooms regularly, I had a big argument with the housekeeping manager.

3051,Goutham Manor,Price is not worth,"Staff are friendly but not clear on customer service. Due to cloudy weather, no hot water. We have to call several time to get it. Hotel asked to pay an additional day for couple of extra hours. After argument they had not charged me extra. Not worth the price."
3052,Lemon Tree Chennai,Good for short stay,"Cleanliness and hospitality was excellent. The complimentary breakfast was good. The only room facility which was not up to the mark was internet, too slow. I stayed as single but rooms would surely can accommodate a family.

3054,Treebo Saravana Boutique Inn,Not equivalent to 3 star Hotel,"The hotel staff are rude and not at all friendly.

3100,The Kings,Tip-happy staff.,"The property was OK but the staff was disappointing. The request for tips was brazen. My room was never cleaned even though the cleaning staff was in the hallway everytime I left the room. I had to put the dishes out in the hallway to be picked up.

3141,Savera,Awesome stay,"The premises is too good. However there is a problem with cleanliness in swimming pool water, otherwise overall experience is good. The hotel must look at its food menu rates. Better if you booked with Makemytrip app so that you can get best prices than any other travel app."
3142,The Raintree,nice hotel with costly add ons,"Hotel room is great, and the staff are very helpful. Located on Anna Salai, So forget taking a walk to get to nearby places. Add ons like lunch/dinner buffet costs too much- but this is expected. One thing I did not like is the presence of too many staffs and the  'vanakkam' they perform at the front door-I did not need that every time I come in- just a smile would have been enough. But the hotel as such no complaints."
3143,Savera,Value for money,"Room was very neat and clean. Business Standard room was quiet spacious. Very good buffet breakfast. There was a gap between floor and main door due to which, you can hear outside corridor noise and vice versa. This may be due to old construction of hotel. Its Gym and Pub - both were really good.

3157,Oriental Inn,,very arrogant and unpleasing receptionist unfit to hold a post in hospitality.

Clean hotel but not so clean surroundings.. At this price point you could get better options in the vicinity if the station, good eating joints (specially Sarvana Bhavan for their southern fare and Annapurna for authentic Bengali cuisine) and to get a feel of Chennai's underbelly then it makes sense to stay here."

3299,Oyo Rooms Chennai International Airport Road,Overall a good experience,I booked with OYO for 2 days and my experience with the service provided by them is quite admirable. Just they need to choose hotels along with food facility. I can rate them 6-7 out of 10.

3307,Radha Regent,Good hotel and experience,Stayed only 10 hours... Good experience. The break-fast is excellent... Especially hospitality in restaurant ( Breakfast) is good. Even though it is complementary they value their customers Only one thing which is not changing in India... The reception people start calling from 11 O clock for check out...

3311,Radisson Blu GRT Chennai,small cluttered rooms but close to the airport,Main benefits of this hotel is proximity to the airport given the extremely heavy traffic in the mornings. Otherwise the hotel is not up to Radisson standards and the rooms are small and cluttered.
3312,The Residency Chennai,,"Overall stay was good. However, the Wi-Fi was not working. We had to call them multiple times to fix it. It gets fixed for some time and then again they would stop working. This was the only thing that we didn't like about this hotel."
3313,Hotel Comfort,Good hotel to stay,Good hotel. It's not luxurious but a good one. It gives full value for money. Very near to marina Beach. Moreover it is near to local market ashima well. Big bazaar and mohan market is nearby. All rooms are AC with restaurant and bar facility.

3317,Ambica Empire,Average hotel to stay,It was just an Ok-Ok place to stay. I stayed there merely because my work place was bang opposite. Poor Service. Poor front office staff. Breakfast buffet was just OK. Nothing great about the hotel. Its an Old hotel. But neat. Good Toilets. Super slow elevator.
3318,The Checkers,Never choose,Worst hotel without any cleanliness & worst maintenance. No neatness & no hot water. Never recommend to any friends and families. Its like a lodge with very dim lighting. It seems hotel in closing stage with poor maintenance

If you want 1-2 nights, its OK hotel."

3425,Savera,Nice stay and good services,"I liked the hotel, people are very nice, good service. But the room in which I was staying 411 would have smoking smell though it was a non smoking room.

I have two words to describe their attitude towards us - 'passive aggressive'. I was told this is a 5 star hotel. I can hardly believe that. Had a disappointing time because of the service. Facilities are great. Food is overpriced."
3433,Lemon Tree Chennai,,"This is actually a 3 star hotel, and in India there are 7 stars, and so a four star rating in Expedia is very misleading. The hotel is not very clean, but for a 2-3 star hotel it is ok if that is what you are expecting, the prices were way too high for that level of quality. I moved to the Hilton, and was very satisfied."

3444,Treebo Elan,Lack of professional ethics and coordination.,"Due to the lack of coordination regarding the registration of the room between the hotel and Expedia, we had to unnecessarily wait for two hours that made us reschedule our plan for the day.

3449,The Westin Chennai Velachery,A nice dose of diaoreah and vomiting.,"I am a very seasoned traveller. Bedrooms are getting tired and frayed. I stayed here for 3 days. I ate NOWHERE else and even then took great care selecting food from buffet avoiding uncooked. I still got sick. Could only be from the buffet in the ground floor restaurant, they had closed the Thai restaurant I have used previously. I won't be going back."
3450,Hilton Chennai,Quick 12 hour stop,In and out quickly and efficiently. Brief overnight stay before heading to airport which is a 15 minute ride away. Only hotel driver to airport was poor. Too fast poor lane discipline and too close to vehicles in front
3451,Hilton Chennai,Good for business vists,"Conveniently located, staff really concerned on your comfort they ensure you get our issue resolved. I had a problem noise from ballroom was too much and my room was noisy. I requested the front desk they quietly accepted the issue arranged an alternative.

3460,New Woodlands,Big hotel with good swimming pool,"I was going to Chennai at last month for some work & visiting Chennai. Me & my sir stayed at hotel New Woodland. It is a big hotel. They have good swimming pool. We stayed here four days. I was enjoyed at Chennai. Like Gandhi sea beach, Merina sea beach, Golden sea beach & Chennai city centre."
3461,Mars,Rude/Worst service - Not recommended to anyone,Hotel website said there is a free pickup/drop to airport but they charged me Rs. 200 for pickup from airport to hotel. When I asked a Person in Reception told rudely that's only applicable for full price NOT applicable for discounted price. If that so why not say that clearly in your website or while booking. Rooms are not that clean.
3462,New Woodlands,Comfortable stay in good location,Had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. Right from the pick-up to the smooth hassle free check-out. The food was tasty and we had a lot of varieties to taste. The best hotel in Chennai and the staff were very helpful prompt and cooperative. The service was excellent and will certainly recommend.

3464,Keys Hotel Katti-Ma,Nice hotel but not value for money,The AC was not working well and after my repeated calling to the service desk they sent an mechanic to fix the issue after 20 mins. Then I would say the door locks are poor as even time in get in to my room I need to call the executive to bring a new card as the locker was not working well.
3465,The Park Chennai,Convenient Stay,Wifi needs to improve
3466,Suriya International,A pathetic hotel with no lift,"Absolutely non cooperative staff. Except location, all others are highly negative. Will neither recommend nor revisit the place. No cleanliness, absolutely money being a sole motto. Reception staff at the age of 70 does not know how to behave with guests."
3467,Peace Inn,Good value for money,"Good ambiance, clean rooms, staff is cooperative, except that the location is some 500 meters away from main road, superb service. Did not try the food as better options were available near by. Only problem is its location, otherwise value for money."
3468,Treebo Hive,Stay Hive,The place is simple for a business stay. The food cooked in house kitchen is clean and freshly made.
3469,Goutham Manor,Great experience,Everything was great. As thought about the hotel it was up to mark.. Just the bed size was bit small as I am tall. Rest everything was good. Dal tadka which I ordered was really good loved eating it. Worth the money. Room size is bit small as compared with other hotels. Location was really great as it main centre of the city.
3470,Suriya International,Very close to where we wanted to be,Great staff and  friendly experience. Very responsive and courteous staff.
3471,Fortune Select Grand,Not a value for money,"Compared to the kind of facilities you get in an International Hotel for the same value, this hotel is not a value for money. Not a good choice for food. The overall experience of my stay is below my expectations and little depressing. The dine area is not a good location with in hotel."
3472,Fortel,Good & affordable hotel to stay,"Fortel Chennai is one of the best luxury hotel in Chennai. It is situated at a prime location in Chennai. It is quite a good hotel providing various type of amenities. Service of the hotel is also good. Clean hotel. Rooms are good and clean. Staff behavior is also very good. Overall, the hotel is good and affordable."
3473,Fortune Select Palms,Nice location and close to main roads & IT firms,Very nice and well maintained. Break fast was worthy. Slight improvement needed in bath Toilet.
3474,Saibala Grand,Staff needs more training in hospitality,This could have been a great experience if its not for the incompetent staff. Staff is rude and should work on their professionalism and cordiality.

3479,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Average stay,I am giving the review as average just because I booked through MMT and got the deal at about 1150/- per day. If you are going for the hotel booking then they will charge about 2500/- etc. Which is absolutely not at all worth it. Rooms are OK if you get it at the range of 1000 to 1300.
3480,Metro Grand,,Comfortable rooms but the dinning area needs to be cleaned. Other than that was a good venue
3481,Taj Club House,Amazing service at the Taj Club House,It was amazing. They went out of their way to accommodate our requests!

3484,Southern Crest,Lovely hotel,"Stay is very good. Food is awesome. They have all facilities to relish. Since it was my business travel, I did not use them.

3487,Maurya International,Nice hotel,Very good and nice stay . staffs are very good . but needs to upgrade room with new fitting  and other acessosiries.
3488,The Park Chennai,Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel they claim to be,They have a good lobby and good place to eat. Everything else comes no way near the 5 star hotel that they claim to be. Rooms are just about 3 star hotel level. Was just disappointed. thankfully had booked here only for a day.
3489,Peace Inn,"Budget friendly, clean and neat hotel","I had been here for my brother admission. Hotel is very clean. Rooms are good bigger and AC works well. A great value for money.

The hotel is free with ventilation and very good atmosphere. We feel very comfortable and very happy to stay there. Nice and excellent hotel for all my family members.
3492,Accord Metropolitan,No value for money,Table and chair not clean. Not value for money. PC lan cable has so much dust but WiFi Internet speed is too good. Bar service is too bad only one waiter serving to all customer. Serving food like tandoori chicken is very salty.
3493,FabHotel Metro Manor Central Station,Nice stay with good rooms & service,"I'm very impressed the rooms and service are good. Foods are excellent. The hotel is fully centralized a/c. And it's near by railway station. I would like to say you must be stay in Hotel Metro Manor. Location is good we can easily get taxi, auto and public transport."
3494,Maple Tree,All basic amenities were provided,The hotel was located in the middle of the city. The check in and checkout was done on time. The room given to me was spacious. All basic amenities were provided in the room. I didn’t take food from the hotel. The activity was not conducted at the hotel. The hotel was value for money.
3495,Raj Park Chennai,Great location and very poor service,"This hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to good restaurants and shopping. However, Service is very poor. Staff seems very poorly trained and paid, and that is exactly the service quality they offer, breakfast not up to the mark, checkout will take a long time so be prepared to add 15-20 minutes if you have a flight to catch, coffee/tea maker in room dirty and not per a 4 star property."
3496,Raj Park Chennai,Bad stay,"Very unhappy despite paying more, waste of money"
3497,The Residency Chennai,Hotel is Centrally Located in heart of Chennai,"This Hotel is Centrally Located in heart of Chennai. Easily accessible from Most of the places in Chennai.

3504,Green Coconut Resort,Green n trees,Not so good
3505,E Hotel,Excellent value for money,"A++ friendly staff, direct access to the avenues mall, food quality great. Can improve by providing atleast 2 towels for a twin room. Stayed with my family for few days. Enjoyed the stay in e hotel. Will visit again."
3506,Savera,A decent hotel with good service,The hotel is clean and comfortable with a wide choice of food in its three restaurants. Staff are courteous and friendly. There is a very efficient travel desk. My request for late checkout was accommodated readily but the amount charged for a 4 hour over stay beyond their usual allowance of 2 hours was a little pinching when compared to the rate I paid for my 2 nights stay through Make My Trip.
3507,BKR Grand,Comfortable stay experience,Good location. Courteous staff. Value for money. Good food. Comfortable. Since it is located in the business area it is also convenient for people who do trading business. For religious trips also it is centrally located in the city of Chennai. The spacious reception lawn is also an attraction. Transportation from outside the hotel is convenient.
3508,Malles Manotaa,"Good but cramped rooms, friendly staff, good location","Good location, clean & tidy rooms, friendly staff. But the rooms are cramped, no space to move around Breakfast was the biggest letdown, just idli, upma & toast, how can you call these 3 items as complimentary breakfast, they said that restaurant is undergoing renovation, hence the limited items"
3509,Savera,Convenient Location/reasonable price,Room was VG.  Bit of difficilty figuring out lighting and electricity on/off functions and hair dryer was not working.  Over all a good value at paid price.  Front desk personnel were PERFECT.
3510,The Park Chennai,"Well located, brand hotel","The hotel is well located in central chennai. Its easy to find places to go out in the evneing after work, or for shopping at the two big malls nearby. They have a nice pool on the 8th floor and several bars in the hotel."
3511,Savera,Good hotel to stay,"The room was good but the health faucet in the toilet was on the wrong side, breakfast was excellent and the overall impression was good. The location of the hotel is central, very close two popular malls."
3512,The Park Chennai,Very dirty rooms,As soon as we entered the room our first thought was not to touch anything as it was very dirty. room was worse then a cheap motel room and you wouldn't want to get close to the bed. This is definitely not a 5* hotel as mentioned on Expedia. Its close to US consulate but with rooms so bad I would rather travel a few minutes then stay here.
3513,Raj Park Chennai,Fine stay ....,It was very nice. I enjoyed my stay there at Raj Park. Amazing.
3514,The Iris,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel, Good Breakfast, Good Service, Helpful Staff"

3518,OMR Guest House,Cool...,Pleasant
3519,My Fortune Chennai,Excellent value for money,Excellent for value of money. Staff of the hotel was prompt on their service either I order in mid night then also they provided the thing I don't like in the hotel was I asked the ice bucket in night and the reply was that we have no ice.
3520,Golden Fruits Business Suites - T Nagar,Excellent hotel to stay,"Except for some of the basic amenities for which they charge (like toothbrush and paste, soap). This hotel is the best at this price. The room service was wonderful. AC at it's best. Cleanliness and room fresheners were optimum. Flexible policies. Even if you want to extend the stay by 1-2 hours, they accept it."
3521,The Park Chennai,Over rated and overpriced Hotel,I am not sure why someone wants to spend that kind of money to be disappointed.
3522,Le Royal M?ridien Chennai,A hotel with good service,"The comfort Inn is really a comfortable hotel for the tourist's, it was amazing to stay in that hotel actually! Overall the infrastructure of the hotel was excellent and I am excited to stay there for the best service that they have done for me with group! I'm sure that I would like to be there for some other time."
3523,Savera,Review and rating,"Bathroom door was terrible. No hand towel and water bottle provided. Bathroom towel was dirty and has to be changed. Room look looked old and worn out. Out side view is a concrete jungle and very badly maintained and dirty terrace
Breakfast was very good. Staff were polite and courteous"
3524,The Ambassador Pallava,"Vintage property in Egmore, Chennai","Stay was comfortable. Its an old property and has a vintage feel to it. Staff is friendly and efficient. Pool is incredibly crowded, mainly kids, maybe due to vacation time."
3525,Maple Tree,Good food and friendly staff,"I went to Aspni hotel in last December. This is a excellent hotel. Staff is excellent and food is very tasty. But money spending is expensive here, sometime you felt like this for some items. Services are not so good they need to improve in this area. Totally good hotel you can enjoy."
3526,Hyatt Regency Chennai,satisfied,enjoyable
3527,Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a 5 star hotel,I had a bad experience and will not visit this hotel again
3528,Raj Park Chennai,Nice stay near by the US Visa Application Centers,"Got for a day and night. Nice staff. Upgraded our stay from Deluxe Double to Superior Deluxe upon our arrival. Very convenient for US Visa application center visits, hardly 2.7 Kms from Main center and 1.6 approx from the OFC. Good restaurants near by."
3529,Holiday Inn Express Chennai Mahindra World City,I wish there was another option in MWC,I didn't like it here. But if you're working in Mahindra World City you don't have any choice. A little competition could probably help things. Staff is nice. Hotel is blah.
3530,Mars,Needs lots of improvement,AC was not at all working in this hot summer. Fan was not fast at all. Could not sleep the whole night. Hot water is not available in bathroom. Smelly room. Too many mosquitos. The only advantage is that we can park our car freely. Breakfast was below average.
3531,Malles Manotaa,single female travellers,"Safe and quiet stay for business travellers
Best place for single female travellers"
3532,Mars,very poor performance,"they did not turn up to pick from air port,kindly return back of rs.200/- against extra taxi fare."

3535,Peace Inn,Good value for money and located conveniently,It was good enough and value to the money. Very near to Marina Beach. Services are good and food is okay.
3536,Harrisons Chennai,Avoidable,Perhaps they were making most of Chennai being almost Sold-out during my stay duration but asking for 5k without even basic facilities like complementary bottled water... Wow!!
3537,The Raintree,nice hotel with costly add ons,"Hotel room is great, and the staff are very helpful. Located on Anna Salai, So forget taking a walk to get to nearby places. Add ons like lunch/dinner buffet costs too much- but this is expected. One thing I did not like is the presence of too many staffs and the  'vanakkam' they perform at the front door-I did not need that every time I come in- just a smile would have been enough. But the hotel as such no complaints."
3538,Lake View Park,A decent budget hotel,"Hotel Lake View is nothing got to do with the name per se. However the hotel is quite neat and clean and strategically located with walking distance from T Nagar and stone throw away from the West Mambalam. Overall, a decent budget hotel for business travellers and value for money."
3539,ITC Grand Chola,Excellent stay experience,"I've booked a room in ITC Grand Chola, Chennai, for my reception. After getting the room card the butler services start. They are with us like a personal assistant in every manner, every second. Totally a privatised hotel for couples. Such a lovely stay at a seven star property. Love you all staff."
3540,Sona's Inn,no extra facilities,"Room was big. Bed was comfy. Location is central. That is it. 
Lights were fused. Bathroom was clogged.Old towels. No tea kettle. Cold breakfast. Smelly room. Hardly any staff. 
Reception staff was helpful. They should give a decent chair for the guard to sit. His chair was old and broken."

We ordered Onion pakoda for evening snacks and it was yummy. Dinner [Phulka and Paneer curry] was hot and tasty. Breakfast was decent. Overall it was a pleasant stay."
3543,Royal Chennai Residency,Good for singal occupancy,Not to go with the net photograph. Rooms are toilet size. Cost is high compare to the facilities.
3544,OYO Rooms Vadapalani Murugan Temple,,The stay was okay. The toilet wasnt very clean and the breakfast was mediocre
3545,Cloud Nine Serviced Apartments,it's great,Nice time.
3546,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Good stay with reasonable rate,"Location and cleanliness is good, but as far as customer service is concerned, it is just average. Recommended for travelers to stay with reasonable rent. Since, the hotel is situated in Mount Road and it is accessible to all city areas. Food is just okay. Good for a quick stay."
3547,Radisson Blu GRT Chennai,Very convenient,If work near airport then the best to be in. Very warm in service the good food make it more comfortable. The live music is amazing. The bodhi spa is just a name to sink in a relax mode. The most courteous staff.

3551,Gokulam Park Sabari OMR,Good stay,Good hotel. The ambience is good. Lobby was superb. Need to improve parking facilities. The food was expensive and it took 40 mins for a starter. In roof top restaurant. The hotel should look into it. Breakfast is excellent and service too.
3552,New Woodlands,Good accomodation to stay,"I had been to Chennai in the month of November. Traveling towards the Chennai I stayed in Woodlands Hotel for one night & one day because of due to heavy rain very good accommodation to stay, far from city. Good food but room rent is expensive. But all so OK."

3557,Mars,Good experience & value for money,"The intercom of the room was not working. Cleanliness was good, free Wi-Fi did not work inside the room. Complementary breakfast was by and large satisfactory. Free Airport dropping was nice, it was on time. The road area outside hotel was dirty. It was a mixed experience. Overall, experience is good and it is value for money."

3559,Emarald,Value of money,Reputed hotel with clean rooms and services for family that will be good option. Love to stay in this hotel. Very near to central railway station just 5 mins walk. Just 2 or 3 km from Marina beach. Overall it was nice stay in that hotel if I will visit again to Chennai I will stay there.
3560,The Kings,Average hotel,"Average hotel with no special facilities like gymnasium, swimming pool. Service is also not crisp. Its a old hotel which has been modified. However good value for money as per location of central Chennai ie Egmore."

Though little dull than compared to other Radisson branded properties."

3773,The Westin Chennai Velachery,short on service standard.,My stay coincided with 2 unfortunate incidences: currency exchange problem with rupees and cyclone vardah.

3834,Hyatt Regency Chennai,Dissappointed,"The linens were smelling bad, and the elevators had a pungent odour. The housekeeping was not up to par of a 5 star hotel. They didn't clean the rooms regularly, I had a big argument with the housekeeping manager.

3840,The Spin,Comfortable Stay,Located very close to the Marina beach and Chepauk Stadium. The railway station and the lovely Express Avenue Mall were also very close. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The morning breakfast included in the room plan could have been more interesting.
3841,Cloud Nine Serviced Apartments,Comfortable and homely stay,I has an appointment near by the hotel so i stayed there for two days. The hotel was in close proximity to lot of places like famous bar and market. Rooms were great with modern amenities and comfortable furniture. Language was a little problem in the area but hotel staff can assist you in case of problem.
3842,E Hotel,Excellent value for money,"A++ friendly staff, direct access to the avenues mall, food quality great. Can improve by providing atleast 2 towels for a twin room. Stayed with my family for few days. Enjoyed the stay in e hotel. Will visit again."
3843,Park Hyatt,Best of the best hotel,Park Hyatt really lived to the hype. The best part of this hotel is the bathroom and roof top swimming pool which gives you a great view of Chennai. Their flagship pub Flying Elephants is really happening on the weekends and as a staying guess you get a free entry to one of the most exciting pubs. The service and ambience of this hotel was top notch and unparalleled.
3844,Maurya International,Excellent location and kind staff,"The location is excellent. Front desk and all the staff are very kind and nice. Hotel food quality is not good, needs variety and quality. Room and water in bathroom is over medicated. There is no facility like swimming pool, gym or any morning exercise place. Room size is small."
3845,Savera,Please try some other hotel,Hotel rooms were very poor with broken floor boards. Receptionist was not ready to take any feedback and no proper response for questions. I wouldn't recommend Savera to anyone. I was charged thrice the amount mentioned on the snack pack.
3846,Aryaas,Good hotel with good food,"Old is gold. A good hotel in Chennai still now. It can be improved by introducing good foods and it can be more useful to compare with the new hotels which have been arriving now a days. New types will increase the efficiency of the hotel. The rooms with the food, TV connection will also paves a beautiful way. The room service should be improved a lot."

3848,Treebo Saravana Boutique Inn,Not good to stay peacefully.,"I booked this hotel because of 3 star rating but it is not worth to 3 star.

Overall not worth for money."

3851,Keys Hotel Katti-Ma,Perfect for Business Travel.,The Hotel is close to the airport and has quick access if your work takes you to OMR road and vicinity. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. Do not expect to flag a auto from outside the hotel as the hotel is tucked away on the street. Thankfully Radio cabs can be easily booked and the hotel is easily located by the drivers.
3852,Holiday Inn Express Chennai Mahindra World City,I wish there was another option in MWC,I didn't like it here. But if you're working in Mahindra World City you don't have any choice. A little competition could probably help things. Staff is nice. Hotel is blah.
3853,Accord Metropolitan,A Good Hotel,"The service is good ,the also provide free Wi-Fi internet connection ,the breakfast is ok but need to do some improvement ."
3854,Aryaas,Good Experiance,"Whether the staff was timely in handling requests and definitely comment about the house keeping service provided, looking very smart and is house keeping is smiling face and all helps and full supported.would do differently if you were to say at that hotel again indoor was very good no noise loud simply super is nice place to near by very good. its like a good experience."
3855,Esthell,"Bad hotel, congested rooms","I stayed in this hotel on a business trip to Chennai. The hospitality is good, but rooms are not good. The rooms are very congested.

3860,The Royal Regency,A very disappointing hotel with minimal service.,This hotel continues the fine tradition of Oyo Hotels using old photographs or one of a room that either does not exist or is made to look good just for the advertising. The foyer is like in the pictures but the other pictures?..
3861,Ekaana Cottages,Good service & not great room,Had difficulty in locating this place. Google map does not guide you to the right place. There was no one at front office when we reached. Room was not great. Bathrooms need to be refurbished/repaired. Highly priced for the facilities and location. Service was good. We got whatever we asked for. But they should have been provided by default.

Food choices are less. Need to expand more.
Also, parking space needs to be expanded. Highly unorganized parking cost me one whole evening plan as I had some other untracked guest's car parked in front of mine."
3865,Park Hyatt,Hotel Review,My experience of the hotel was very nice. The transportation facility was not provided by the hotel. The activities were available at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for upcoming travellers.

My Favt. Food is Idly and vada."
3874,The Ambassador Pallava,Average stay,"Pretty average stay, Location and all was fine but then, booked the same basis reviews, that prove to be exaggerated! Checked in late night at around 11. 30 PM, ordered Dinner, it took almost 1 hour for delivery and the dish was not the one that was ordered. WiFi never worked. Breakfast average. Overall, if you are willing to compromise on certain aspects, I would say Value for Money."

3877,Treebo Saravana Boutique Inn,Treebo Saravana Chennai,"Clean, functional place to stay. Not quite as close to Marina Beach as it states, as we found out when we started walking! Still walkable distance though. Lots of little shops + market stalls around but did not see obvious places to eat. Not an obvious area for foreign tourists to stay as we did not find any other tourists in the area. This is not a problem for us but might be to others."
3878,JP Hotel,Decent hotel,It's ok for couple of nights. WiFi works. Basic amenities ok.

3884,Lloyds Guest House - US Consulate,Good hotel close to US Consulate,"I picked this hotel for my parents who were attending their US visa interview at Chennai.

3885,Accord Metropolitan,Perfect hotel for family and business trip,"I was on my business trip & my stay was for two days, I found perfect hotel with excellent cleanliness and location is also perfect, nice.

Will never recommend this hotel to anyone.
3896,E Hotel,Nice to stay,"Had a pleasant stay. Staff and service is very good. Since the hotel is located in the city, it is very easy to go anywhere and in the free time we can roam in the express avenue mall which is located in the same premises. Would love to stay again."

4081,Aryaas,Located well with well-maintained rooms,"Good hotel located in heart of the city of Chennai! Rooms are well-maintained any very hygienic. They will provide you with a welcome kit includes tooth brush, oil, talc powder etc. Food is awesome but bit costlier but people can enjoy the stay. It also attached with a bar and you can enjoy your drink also."

4088,Radisson Blu GRT Chennai,Value for Money,Superb hotel. Their hospitality was superb and all marks to them. The breakfast was superb. All was good. The airport pick and drop was excellent. Nothing wrong there. One touch service was excellent. The only weaker part was the room were old fashioned. They need to renovate it. Not really wrong with the room but the modern room this days are excellent. Worth the money.

4094,The Centre Point,Good hotel but very expensive,Had a good stay here. Location perspective this hotel was good for me.But for the amount they charge and the service they provide is not worth.

4095,Taj Coromandel,Just about perfect stay !!,"Staff are very well trained and quite helpful and not helpful to the point of being annoying.

The Hotel is located very much on the IT highway. The hotel can be easily accessed through public transport as well. The rooms are neat and clean. Don't forget to ask the road side view rooms for better view.
4097,The Royal Regency,Room is not at all clean,Room is not at all clean and sprayed with mosquito chemicals and smells bad. Also they are doing refurbishing the hotel and sounds are irritating and not able to take a sleep at all. Also many times I told them to stop or change the room after one hour stopped that sound by repeated calls only.
4098,Regency Royal Paris,Room was very good & location is superb,"Very clean, helpful staff, near the airport and good value for money. Nice breakfast served, a lot of security is installed for making sure of complete security of the visitors.

But all so OK."
4107,Savera,Wouldn't recommend for more than a day's stay,"Repeated follow ups for hot water and internet didn't fix the problem. The staff was prompt but in a 4 star hotel hot water and internet should not be an issue.

There was drilling going on all day on the roof due to construction work, there was a Bollywood movie set going on all day for three days that made movement in the hotel a pain, the hotel smelt musty and damp and the floors were sticky. The choice of food for non chilli eaters was non existent. I checked out and moved to a much better hotel."
4200,Hilton Chennai,Awesome location and friendly staff,"The location is awesome, front office staff is very friendly, sweet and soft spoken. I like the stay, but room was very compact and beautiful, linen is very neat and clean, including towel, etc. The food was awesome, awesome service, woh, varieties and value for money."
4201,Oyo Rooms Guindy Olympia Tech Park,Cost effective stay,"The rooms are clean, new mattresses and fittings. The AC works very well and the room smells clean. This is a quiet neighbourhood. The staff are very attentive and responsive to customer requests. All in all, a very cost effective and clean option in the Tech Park area."
4202,Gokulam Park Sabari OMR,Good room & good cleanliness,Room was good. Cleanliness was good. TV cable was not working when I reached hotel when I complained they told it'll take 2 hrs but it till night problem was there.. And TV picture quality was poor not expected from this type of hotels even low grade hotel provide better one Guest was not allowed to come to room to meet even if they have valid ID proof even though in rules it was written with valid local ID proof it's allowed.
4203,Hotel Grand Residence Porur,Avarage hotel for short stay,Stay in this hotel because of my tavel plan convenient. Stay in this hotel was good. Hotel staff is friendly Breakfast was good. Food qualiry is also good. Good for short stay. In surrounding lot of taffic and noise. WiFi connection was average.
4204,Taj Club House,An oasis for the city traveller,"An oasis of comfort in a busy chaotic town. A very pleasant and restful,a place I looked forward to returning after each day's foray into the busy city."
4205,Dee Cee Manor,Very bad experience,"Very bad experience, only the rooms are OK, but the service was very bad, no towels was in the bathroom and no soap, shampoo was provided. The morning breakfast was totally waste, only four items and no responsible person was not there in dining, so we have breakfast in nearby restaurant. Service, poor breakfast, no basic amenities, no response from reception, overall very bad experience."
4206,MGM Eastwoods,Good hotel,Its not a beach resort as it says. Its a normal resort but good for stay. Food was good. And staff was helpful. Swimming pool was wel maintained. Overall it was a good experience. The only thing was we thought it was a beach resort but its is a usual and normal resort
4207,"Radisson Chennai City Centre, India",I had visited this hotel with my family. The transport facility was available at the hotel. The hotel appearance was good.,Conversation was not that much
4208,Le Royal M?ridien Chennai,I never stay back here.,There are lot of hidden charges in this hotel. I ended up paying around 50 % extra above the room rate in addition to the tax. I never stay back here.
4209,Ambica Empire,"Location is good, food and service is bad",The hotel location is good! Food served was cold and pathetic! Staff response is very bad. Food served in the buffet was so bad that we could it eat. Even the soup was cold. I felt I wasted 800 rs for such kind of food. This is not the Ambica Hotel that once it used to be. Would recommend all to think twice before booking room in this hotel.
4210,Hilton Chennai,Great check in,"Short stay arrived at 4.30 am from airport, departed at Noon. Check in swift which you want in middle of night. I had lost my HH card, they managed to sign me up again overnight"
4211,Manickam Grand,comfortable rooms,it was a nice one the only problem we face is of food and cold water. you need to buy a water bottle to get acold water.
4212,Park Hyatt,Splendid food quality & upto the mark service,It was a bright Sunday and myself with my family decided to check-in Park Hyatt in Guindy and as we expected it was the experience to cherish. It gave the absolute delight of being in the star hotel and the food quality was splendid. The service was also upto the mark of a five star hotel. Summing up all it made it crisp experience on Sunday morning.
4213,Accord Metropolitan,Loved it,"Cannot think of any negative for this hotel. Right from check in to check out, it was all smooth and an experience to remember. One for one offer for residents at Zodiac made it better. Located in the heart of the shopping district and easily accessible by all modes. Some of the staff had difficulty understanding English, rest all was good."
4214,Radha Regent,Basic,I have stayed at the radha many times due to its location for my business. The rooms are run down and basic with need of updating. The noise level at night due to live music within the hotel is annoying but is over by midnight. That said the service is always exceptional and the food in the lobby lounge is also excellent.
4215,ITC Grand Chola,Wonderful stay in great Chennai,"ITC Grand Chola - A Luxury Collection Hotel. Wonderful stay in great Chennai. Excellent location and facilities. Great hospitality and ambiance. Good place to stay. Beautiful rooms with free wifi. Excellent breakfast and last but not the least, a very good swimming pool."
4216,The Royal Regency,The renovation work is going on,The renovation work going on.. AC was Not good. No LED TVs provided. Hotels with this tariff level normally provide complimentary breakfast.

4217,Hotel Kensington,Good location and spacious rooms,"Best hotel for the given price range and near by bus stop. Opposite to Sathyabama College, beside the main road. The rooms are very spacious and neat. The service of the hotel is also very quick and proper. The maintenance of room is quite impressive."
4218,Maple Tree,"Average hotel to stay, good south Indian food","As per my business schedule I had visited to Chennai. Location of hotel is fair enough to everyone to identify.

4219,ITC Grand Chola,Excellent five star hotel and very near to airport,"Excellent view. Great service and great food. Swimming pool has excellent view from room. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Very good security. Has all kind of italian, pan asian and south indian food. Room AC, TV and lights can be operated from IPOD."
4220,Green Meadows,Not value for money,"The actual hotel rooms are not as good as it shows in pics/website. Food (though limited options under complimentary breakfast) & the exteriors were good. The chlorine content in swimming pool was extremely high. Overall, the tariffs - rooms & food - are costly and not worth the high price."
4221,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Conversation was not that much,Radisson Hotel Delhi
4222,Grand Chennai by GRT Hotels,,Hotel staff are terrible and their policies. Everything you need to pay over priced. May be the owner trying to recover his renovation cost fast from guests.  Pls read carefully before booking/checking this hotel. They will empty your wallet.
4223,Hotel Shelter,Nice hotel with few service backdrops,Only few backdrops in service ... Like room key system not working so had to wait for check in and other service issue ... Otherwise nice and clean rooms and very good location ... Value for money only if booked after getting some discount ... Or else it is expensive
4224,Peace Inn,"The hotel is good, the food not so good","We stayed there for 2 days and I have to say, I am impressed. The locality was not so good, but the rooms were pretty neat, I have to admit. The hotel provides Wi-Fi facility for its customers to be connected at all times. Their reception of customers was really great and they even gave us rebate of 700/- INR. It's pretty close to the airport, so it’s a good choice for anyone."
4225,Sheraton Park Hotel & Towers,"Excellent Service, Fantastic Breakfast","Hotel has great ambiance and is located in the up-class neighbourhood of Adyar Park. Service is excellent, breakfast from the Cappuccino Cafe is fantastic. Although it is stated on hotels.com that wifi is paid, I received free wifi from the hotel because of my IHG rewards membership. Hotel is a little old (was formally Sheraton), but has good facilities. I enjoyed the gym as well as the Spa located within the hotel."
4226,Shan Royal,Average stay,WiFi is very bad rest all good. Room is good and food also good so stable place. I forgot my mobile charger and they didn't inform me. Room and every thing is very good only is that location was little hard to find.
4227,Green Park,"Nice place, but very expensive.","Good place to live, but was very expensive. Food was good had lot of varieties. I would recommend only if the nightly price is little less.close to everywhere. Shopping, good food spots, easy to commute around. I stayed for 4 days. Had it been cheaper in price it would have been better."
4228,Akshay Inn,Great stay with good staff,"We had a pleasant stay at this place when I came down to Chennai for a visit to couple of offices near this place. The staff were kind enough to accommodate our requests like an early breakfast, assisting us to get to our place etc. The rooms were very clean albeit smaller than what I had in mind. Totally recommend this place."
4229,Ambica Empire,Nice stay & good breakfast,"Nice stay, enjoyed one day visit, good breakfast was nice but less north Indian options, service OK but needs improvement, good hotel for business purpose, rooms are OK but needs slight renovation. But good trip."
4230,Green Meadows,Amazing room service but old rooms,"The guys at the reception and the room service are literally amazing, they are courteous and very helpful.

4231,Mars Classic,so bad!,"it was so bad I didn't stay. the room was dirty, the service was the bad (didn't agree to call the manger even that we ask to speak with him), no WIFI , and you are sleeping in a gas station area!!!"

4297,Somerset Greenways,This is not a 5 star hotel,At best I would rate it 4 star. The Restaurant is ok but again nothing like 5 star.  The rooftop pool is very good and that's  the reason I gave a 4 for facilities.  At night you can hear the dogs barking in the street below.  Outside the hotel its pretty grim with a lot of rubbish left lying around.
4298,Courtyard Chennai India,Awesome stay with helpful staff,"Had very good experience. I stayed in this hotel with my friends. The staff of this hotel is very helpful and quick. A/C facility is available. Its location is well-maintained also the water is very neat and clean. Special foods are available here. The weather is perfect. All kinds of foods are available here.

I would suggest this hotel to improve renovate the room.
4302,Bhimaas,Not worth for money,Except the location. Not worth for money. Stinking toilets and very small. Don't try this hotel. You will be more disappointed based on the location of this hotel. Horrible tea and coffee too. AC remote won't work etc. Nothing to say positive.
4303,Melody,Wouldn't recommend at all!,Hotel staff aren't friendly. Room was dirty and not nice. They tried to keep my passport and hotel confirmation. I wasn't happy. Shower was broken and dangerous. Mosquitoes.

The hotel is also well situated in the center of town and shopping area."
4308,The Residency Chennai,It was a very good hotel,Pacific Clarks Inn
4309,Savera,A decent hotel with good service,The hotel is clean and comfortable with a wide choice of food in its three restaurants. Staff are courteous and friendly. There is a very efficient travel desk. My request for late checkout was accommodated readily but the amount charged for a 4 hour over stay beyond their usual allowance of 2 hours was a little pinching when compared to the rate I paid for my 2 nights stay through Make My Trip.
4310,Asiana Place,Best place and suitable for corporate people stay,"One of the best place near by OMR road and great environment. Excellent room services, food taste was too good, rooms are very well-furnished and are in excellent condition. We have a wonderful parking area too. As the hotel is located in Ascendas IT Park, it is much suitable for corporate guys."
4311,Chennai Palace,Not located well and and very unhygienic,"It was a big mistake I booked that hotel. I was looking for a room near High Court, as I can avoid the travelling in the morning. But it's took so much time to reach there as this hotel located in a non familiar lane. Rooms and bathroom were leaking from sealing. Very unhygienic. No food, not even tea. It's not even worth for 200/ per day. I say big NO NO NO to this hotel."

4316,Hyatt Regency Chennai,Not a 5 star hotel,I had a bad experience and will not visit this hotel again
4317,Ammu Palace,Hotel is horrible.,"Hotel is horrible in terms of cleanliness, locality, people around etc.
Wifi is available only at lobby, that too on request repeatedly.
The owners switches off the AC repeatedly.
No hot water for bath.
Even the towels and soaps are on demand only.
Area is not safe at all.
If you budget is not more that $10 (Rs.600) go for it. Else definitely not recommendable."
4318,Radisson Blu GRT Chennai,Great place to unwind after flying!,"This hotel had wonderful food, lounge, spa and rooms! We really appreciated this great choice of location to unwind after flying several hours from the US, and then flying out again the next day. The massage and spa staff were great, the breakfast was very enjoyable. We will definitely stay here again."
4319,Hanu Reddy Residences Poes Garden,Horrible experience,It was a horrible experience. I don't know why MMT refers such filthy places. It spoils the credentials of MMT. It can be just termed as a guest house. Improved version of dormitory. Floor is with old styled tiles. Not even a carpet. AC does not work. A ceiling fan in room which makes hell lot of noise.

4362,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Average stay,I am giving the review as average just because I booked through MMT and got the deal at about 1150/- per day. If you are going for the hotel booking then they will charge about 2500/- etc. Which is absolutely not at all worth it. Rooms are OK if you get it at the range of 1000 to 1300.
4363,The Mount Manor,Not a good value for money,"Not a good VALUE for money. Will not prefer it again. Location is OK but other facilities are below expectations. Congested rooms, low quality of food, even while checking out, it took 30 minutes to clear food bills. Could be better maintained."

Good wifi speed
Even though close to main road and a busy railline, no sound was felt due to sound proof windows"
4371,Accord Metropolitan,Not too comfortable,"It seems that hotel does not check the basic amenities in the room, before handing over the room to the traveller.  The phone in my room was not working and it created a problem for me, as after a hectic day of travel you would like to relax and work at your own pace. So they sent the technician who kept on looking for the fix for about an hour and then i had to get my room changed."
4372,Lake View Park,Stay with nominal price,Stay here if you want to stay at minimum price. Enjoy the free breakfast. There are many other hotels nearby. Enjoy your lunch and dinner there. Good place to shop for family and friends. Take a list of all the bus numbers to the place you want to visit. The auto drivers will loot you if don't know to bargain.

Google maps shows entirely different location, half a kilo meters south. Phones are not reachable, and hotels.com also tried to reach them but in vain. Checkin checkout times are not posted in hotels.com which makes it difficult to decide on a hotel of our choice. Bathroom shower appliances are dirty"
4403,The Vijay Park-Arumbakkam,Think twice before booking,"Useless hotel, Room is dirty, Linen were smelly, Toilet worst, water leaking all the time, corridor just like a old mansion not repaired and all walls broken. Can give a lot of description. Do think twice before you book the room"

A sheer pain in the wallet experience."

Rest other things are okay with the hotel."

Staff were polite and helpful.
We'd certainly recommend the Somerset!"

4446,Aloft Chennai Omr - It Expressway,An average stay too far from Chennai,"Friendly staff but lack of process and quality visible everywhere. Food was fine for an average Indian guest, but my colleague didn't had any great choices. A bar with fewer options, housekeeping staff who needs multiple reminders, made the stay to the other side of expectations, especially to someone who is experienced with an Aloft stay in some other country."

4454,Turyaa Chennai,Simply superb hotel,"The short word to say this hotel is SS (Simply Superb). I think there are totally 9 floors in the hotel, we stayed at the 8th floor. The dedication of the staff makes me high to stay in this hotel. The variety of foods are so good."
4455,Hotel Grand Residence Porur,Pathetic experience!,Hotel was getting renovated when I happened to stay at this place!! AC in the room was not working and I had to shift to other room and even there the AC was not working. The staff and service was also not that great. I would not recommend this place for stay as there are better options available.

4460,The Park Chennai,Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel they claim to be,They have a good lobby and good place to eat. Everything else comes no way near the 5 star hotel that they claim to be. Rooms are just about 3 star hotel level. Was just disappointed. thankfully had booked here only for a day.
4461,"The Raintree, St. Mary's Road",Great hotel and breakfast buffet,Great hotel and breakfast buffet. Outstanding staff. Stayed with my family but probably ideal for the business traveler.

With amazing food with different varieties, with awesome service and good location ... Where you meet good people with good thinking with no bad thing in their mind."
4463,Hotel Pandian,Good stay with clean rooms,Although I took single non AC room. It was not so comfortable. Bed was very compact. The room was clean and bathroom very hygiene. For value of money I can say it was satisfactory. There was nothing much to do with room service. The best part was even with such cheap rate room they have provided the breakfast. As breakfast was so.. Any how in such rate what you want more than that.

4468,"Radisson Chennai City Centre, India",Great Service! :),"Fantastic service by staff at every touch point. They were very friendly and helpful, and especially so when we were stuck in Chennai due to the floods notwithstanding the hotel running at full occupancy. Cannot imagine staying at another hotel in such times - they have really taken good care of us!"
4469,Lemon Tree Chennai,Average stay,"Compared to other lemon tree stay, this was bit disappointing compared to the room comfortability."
4470,Planet Mount,Good location and the service,"I stay here for office work and find it is good budget hotel and nearby to many central places such as Mount road, T Nagar etc which are shopping places. Service and cleanliness is very good including food quality. Shall recommend to my friends. They provide other assistance such as taxi for site seeing and have good room facilities."
4471,Raj Park Chennai,Worst stay ever.,"Booked a Deluxe Room with an occupancy for 2 people. The room that we got had below amenities:

1) No Ventilation.
2) The room was stinky(The room was smelling like it was in close proximity with drainage) 
3) Congested (The room was very small)
4) The window opened(open the curtain) into a huge wall which was 2 feet away. Which means forget the natural light you cant even see the sky from the room with an opened window."
4472,Marsan Lodge,Marsan stay feedback,"We did not received complimentary pickup and had to pay to Taxi ourself, which is not good. we were promise payback in to account but never received the money paid for taxi."
4473,Chennai Palace,Healthy food and good location,"Chennai is very good place, this place is very hot and humid. Last year I went to Chennai with my family and we stayed Chennai Palace Hotel. In that hotel we stayed for 3 days, the hotel staff are well behaved they help us every time. Hotel location are good, also there food are different tasty and healthy."
4474,Park Hyatt,Bad experience,"As soon as I checked-in, I found pungent smell in the room. Even after informing customer service desk, it took them quite long time to allocate new room and that to after multiple follow ups. Moreover, the food served at room was not good. It looked that it was not prepared by chef."
4475,The Pride,Good stay but food was pathetic,"Good locality, rooms were good but food was pathetic. Seen mosquitoes, flies and some other small insects were taking breakfast along with us. Seen cockroach in the dining. Otherwise it was a nice stay. If you plan to stay, better plan to have your food outside."
4476,Ngh Transit,Expedia must remove this hotel asap from their ...,"Expedia must remove this hotel asap from their list.
Because of this terrible I now don't trust expedia as well !!!"
4477,Le Park Inn,Very Convenient place to stay,Best place to stay with good food varieties and room service.Rooms are a bit small but convenient enough to stay.
4478,Hotel Pandian,Budget hotel adequate for short stay.,Breakfast was Indian buffet style. Difficult to get simple black coffee and omelette. Restaurant manager not very pleasant or accommodating. Could do with a few lessons from bar staff who were great.
4479,La Woods,Budget hotel,"The hotel is really good and worth your stay for the budget, location and food. It is located very close to Express Avenue mall and Spencer plaza and easy to connect to locality of Chennai. It's a stay that not to be missed."
4480,Raj Park Chennai,Stay at Raj Park,0
4481,Lemon Tree Chennai,,The service could improve. A lot of time taken for room service.
4482,Savera,Awesome Stay,Great stay at Savera Hotel during my official trip to Chennai. Located in the heart of the city. 5 Star hospitality that you could expect from a porter too. Nice rooms and delicious food. Commendable room service. A lot of options in breakfast. Will surely recommend to my dear ones.
4483,The Mount Manor,Poor interiors,Bathrooms are very poor needs upgrade and cleanliness should be improved. Towels must be more better and they must manage to keep mosquitoes away. Overall room interior was too poor against the base rate they charge. They need to improve their breakfast menu. Too small only one fruit and juice is too less.
4484,Aadithya,Homely hotel with well-equipped rooms,"Restaurant rate will be reduced. It will be happy if it located at the centre for Egmore and Central Railway Station with high safety because, so that is near to the police commissioner office. This hotel steps are very small. Room is well-equipped with spacious veranda."
4485,Treebo Angson,try at your own risk,"no restaurant as mentioned, no king size bed, no travel desk....it's my worst experience"
4486,ITC Grand Chola,Good stay,Everything was nice and nothing to complain about. Breakfast was good with spread out choices line other itc properties. In room dining doesn't have many choices that's the only negative I would say about.
4487,Opera Residency,Nice hotel in this area and tarriff was high,"Though the location of the hotel is a congested one, the rooms were neat & clean. Rooms were good though pretty small. Tariff is too high- Single Ac more than 1500 for such features. Very small car parking for just 1 or 2 cars. Car parking should be developed & rates should be lowered to make more guests like this hotel. Also there is one or no service boys at times."
4488,OMR Guest House,Not advisable for longer stays,"They don't know what hotel service is at all. Hardly any room service is there or they provide. The positive point is the location but nothing else you can expect what you can normally look for in a hotel service. But for a day's accommodation, it's ok. Not advisable for longer stays."
4489,Mars Classic,Not up to the mark,"Customers are request to avoid this hotel. Food is pathetic, rooms are not as seen in the photos, rooms are not clean, it is not value for the money even after the MMT voucher. MMT should avoid this hotel from their list."
4490,Season 4 Guest House,Conversation was not that much,The destination of the hotel was good. The location of the hotel was good. The appearance of the hotel was good. The check in and checkout was not delayed. The overall service of the hotel was good. The complimentary breakfast was provided in the hotel. The food was nice with quality and quantity. There were no activities arranged by this hotel. I don’t have any suggestion for this hotel.
4491,Treebo Saravana Boutique Inn,Average hotel near to beach,"Rooms are very small. But all the amenities are available in room. Free breakfast, newspaper, WiFi. But location of the hotel is in Mirshahibpet market. As it is in a market area so the hotel front area is a little bit congested. Good for short stay."
4492,Treebo Angson,Average hotel,The hotel is good bt the location is too interior.
4493,Sheraton Park Hotel & Towers,"Good choice of restaurants 
Nice bar","Staff were excellent
We were there for 5 nights with elderly parents and the staff could not do enough to make our stay comfortable
Rooms are clean
Room service is prompt"
4494,Accord Metropolitan,Good stay & nice location,Very good stay. Nice location. Suggest to offer breakfast included in that offer. Also check to offer for complimentary pick up and drop to airport. These things add value to offer and certainly increased business. All the best. Will certainly recommend to stay at this hotel.
4495,Sona's Inn,,"Service and condition is not good for the price
Service and condition is not good for the price

Service and condition is not good for the price
Service and condition is not good for the price"
4496,Victoria,It's good,Good location clean room but poor hospitality but I think this is better option compare prices of other hotel's because location is too good near egmore railway station Chennai and make my trip reduced the rent just half so make my trip.
4497,Ginger Hotel,Good facilities and spacious room,"Hotel looked quite ordinary and I should say hotel should improve its decoration and overall appearance because it was looking very basic and ordinary. Room was very good in space and it was well maintained had quite good facilities, all appliances were working fine. Room services was timely and food was quite good and very nicely prepared. Considering its good facilities it's a good hotel."
4498,The Raintree,PERSONAL,The hotel location is good... but the beds are very bad and old. The shower room was not all clean.
4499,ITC Grand Chola,Responsible luxury,A luxurious stay
4500,Hotel Grand Residence Porur,Average!!,"It was ok, but would not prefer it if have an alternative."
4501,Fortune Select Palms,Conversation was not that much,I had visited this hotel for official purpose. The hotel was located inside the city. The Wi-Fi facility was available in the hotel. The coffee maker was available in the rom. The food quality was nice in the hotel. The food was not value for money.
4502,Gemini Inn,Stay away from this,"Not at all good Hotel, but seems you get what you pay for. This was little cheaper than rest, but issue with was things mentioned were not available. For example, in menu they have many choices to choose from but when you order they have just one or two items available. With kids it was difficult to manage there."
4503,Holiday Inn Express Chennai Mahindra World City,Good stay,Great hospitality
4504,Holiday Inn Express Chennai Mahindra World City,Great place for a night or two stay.,"I think it was good, front desk team were very accommodating and courteous. Food was great and in room dining were very prompt. As a whole it's a good experience."
4505,New Woodlands,Highly recommend New Woodlands,Perfect travellers hotel. Great services and wonderful food. The rooms are neat and clean and well kept. The newly furnished rooms are even classy. For regular visitors and tourists absolute value for money. No need of wasting money in needlessly fancy hotels.
4506,Goutham Manor,Pleasant stay,Though it was a short one... But Mr. Pervez from marketing team gives us ease and enhanced the comfortableness... Overall it was a good stay and value for money thing. You will find staff very cooperative.. Food could have been better but room service is up to the mark and very prompt.
4507,Gemini Inn,worst room I have ever stayed,I have stayed on the same property 3-4 times earlier. but this time it was horrible. the room was not clean. The towel provided by the hotel had lot of dirt. There where lot of spots in the bed spread. And to top it off it had all the pest including cockroach and bed bugs. I will never return here even if some one pays me to stay there.
4508,Hotel Kensington,,Hotel is situated in OMR road which is little away from town and the hotel condition is not that good for a family stay. Room service is not at all good
4509,Gokulam Park Sabari OMR,Best ambience & value for money,"Firstly I would tell it's a value for money stay. The rooms are well-maintained and spacious too so, definitely value for money. Secondly I would say the rooftop bar has got the best ambience and it's because of this I loved this hotel. Morning buffet was good. So overall, I would rate 9 out of 10."
4510,Sai Enclave Residency,Small Rooms,"Very small rooms. Even we paid extra for 3rd person. They didnot allot proper room, where 3 people can fit.
Room was very congested."
4511,Beach Park Resort,Superb resort to stay,"Its a superb resort/hotel to stay in East Coast Road, Chennai adjacent to Beach. Though it is suited to go with both family and friends. It is best suited to go with friends. Table tennis, swimming pool, carom and snooker will keep you entertained. I enjoyed my stay with friends on New Year with a good DJ."
4512,The Park Chennai,Experience not at par as claimed!!,"This property is a bit old. Bath tub, toilets are old and had stains. White towels were provided, but even they had stains and dirty."
4513,Raj Palace Hotel,Nice place,"The room was very nice, although, the bed was stiff as a board. That actually worked out well, I slept very well. The breakfast room is very small, but that gave me the opportunity to share conversation with a stranger. The breakfast buffet was limited, but really delicious and fresh, high quality items were served."
4514,Orchid Inn Woods Road,Not worth for the cost,It is not worth for thee cost They moved to different address which is not being updated at MakyMytrip.
4515,Nachiappa Park,Clean and good service,"Room are neatly maintained and staff are very helpful. The hotel location is good and it is close to shopping centers. Breakfast is good, although not the best. Would recommend staying at this hotel. Also need to make sure you let them know if there is a change in check in and check out times."
4516,BKR Grand,,Average hotel. Preferred because of close proximity for shopping.
4517,Dee Cee Manor,Worst room & not recommended,"No hot water. Water was not flowing, no phone, one of the worst rooms they gave us. The staff is totally indifferent to our complaints and no courtesy. Booked for 2 nights but checked out after a night stay, you have better choice of hotels for the price. I don't recommend to anyone. The star rating for this hotel is misleading. Please remove this hotel from your website, it is a shame."
4518,Ginger Hotel,Small. Bad room service,"The whole hotel is just one floor of the research park. Power kept going off and the wi-fi was flaky at best. Stay tried their best to help but there experience was not good especially considering there price. 

The room was small. Window was tiny and the room service was OK at best. 

The towels were not soft and they gave just one towel?!"
4519,The Spring,Review the spring hotel,"12 pm check in for make my trip bookings, very strictly, even MMT refused to interfere, staff unless asked don't bother, food average, juice with mosquito was served during breakfast, un maintained costly bathroom fittings .."
4520,Holiday Inn Express Chennai Mahindra World City,I wish there was another option in MWC,I didn't like it here. But if you're working in Mahindra World City you don't have any choice. A little competition could probably help things. Staff is nice. Hotel is blah.
4521,Everest,,Average. Not satisfied...
4522,FabHotel Blossoms T Nagar,Good location with average experience,"The hotel is located at a very strategic place from where all the things are very nearby and one would not face any challenge. Its not a very big hotel, however the staff is cooperative and we had to manage the food from outside mostly. Overall it was a very good location with average experience."
4523,Redsun Serviced Apartments,Not worth for money,"The listing states this place as a hotel but it is not a hotel but a furnished apartment. The service lacked everything, even the bed sheets smelled and were dirty. It was nowhere worth a single rupee of the 5800/- spent. I want a refund for my stay."
4524,The Spring,Good location but very congested,Good location if you are going for visa interview for USA. Otherwise if come out of hotel you cannot take a walk. Footpaths are horrible or there is no footpath. Feel very expensive for the size and comfort. Very congested and no space even to stretch yourselves.
4525,Akash Inn,SO SO HOTEL,"In my recent visit to my home town I was searching for nearby restaurant for home delivery, I found this ordered egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, naan and chicken kassa. The real problem was delivery, after many followup they delivered 1 hr 30 late though they said it would take only 20min good part was food tasted good Food 3.5/5 Service 2/5 VFM 4/5"
4526,Treebo J's Five Two Boutique,A fantastic place to stay,"I have been staying here for quite some time having made four visits in the last 2 months.

4530,Park Hyatt,WYSIWYG.,"First time stay. Loved it. Everyone was super polite, helpful, nice.
One needs to check the final bill as there can be errors."
4531,Mars,Overall average stay,The advantage is close to airport. There is ample car parking facility. The approach road is very bad and the drainage water flowing in front of the hotel which is quit bad. This is slightly inside from the Pallavaram main road which is hugely populated and heavy traffic.
4532,Benzz Park,Expensive food,"The food quality is not par with the charges they levy, it is quite expensive but quality is average."
4533,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Average,Pros Location-Value for business people they wnt stay at room fr long time Cons Very Old Building-Feels like the building will collapse at any time. Overall it is not well recommended but it's good for budget travellers
4534,The Pride,Decent place to stay,Clean and safe. WiFi was somehow not working the entire 3 days I was there. Overall. I'd recommend it to others as well. Location is good as it is on the main road itself and it is easy to move around from here.
4535,Treebo Elan,Great location!!,"The place was amazing, a good location, however it was hard to communicate with the staff because they hardly speak english or any other language that is not their own."
4536,FabHotel Priyadarshini Park Mount Road,Decent place,"Nothing much to write about as it was just one night to stay. Terrible breakfast , unclean plates cups etc. the first room they gave was smelling of cigarettes smoke fortunately they changed the room. AC was just about ok. Small tacky room"

Thank you......"
4538,Frangi House,Good hotel to stay with spacious rooms,"On my last visit to Chennai had stayed in this hotel. I must say it is one of the finest hotel in Chennai.

4541,Dream Inn-Omr,Horrible experience,It's not a hotel anymore. It is converted into PG. Horrible stay. No service and you get too many mosquitoes for free. Take something for it because you won't get anything for the same. No wifi. Food not good and if you order a tea then order it before 2 hours because you will get it at least by 2 hours.
4542,The Centre Point,Good hotel,"Good location. Courteous staff. Good room service. Small room. Hotel under renovation. The hotel itself is a small building. Parking facilities are limited. Overall very friendly and polite staff. Was impressed with the food ordered from service. It is ideal for business travellers, not so much for families."
4543,Star City Serviced Apartments,Excellent price for a super property,"First of all thanks to Makemytrip to offer an excellent price for a super property. The hotel management is good in spite they don't have kitchen. They offered sure breakfast from standard hotel. Room was super, thanks both. Try to provide this price for some time."

4545,Hanu Reddy Residences Wallace Garden,Convenient location and spacious rooms,Very good location. Despite its proximity to the busiest part of the city there was barely any noise around. Easy to travel around Chennai from this property. Can't rate the food because I didn't try it. Rooms were spacious and neat and captures the character of the city in its styling.

4547,FabHotel Blossoms T Nagar,Location is very good near T.Nagar,"Location is very good near T.Nagar, the best market area. We passed leisure time to stroll the market. Breakfast was free in the restaurant in the ground floor. The persons in the reception were well behaved and sober."

4550,Malles Manotaa,A decent stay,"Amazing hotel. Good decor and very clean, In the heart of the city, commuting anywhere in Delhi is very easy. Staff there is friendly and courteous. Room service is very prompt. Breakfast is good. WiFi speed was really good. Overall good value for money."
4551,Hotel Pandian,Not worthy of the money,I booked a king bed for my parents but when they arrived we got only standard double bed.Even after showing the booking confirmation the staff resisted on giving the king bed.
4552,Raj Park Chennai,Very good hotel to stay,Hotel Raj Park is a very good one located in main location of city. The room ambience is very good. Food served is very tasty. The stay is really worth able for the amount we spend. Finally service given is nice. We can reach the hotel very easily from any corner of the city.
4553,The Park Chennai,Very dirty rooms,As soon as we entered the room our first thought was not to touch anything as it was very dirty. room was worse then a cheap motel room and you wouldn't want to get close to the bed. This is definitely not a 5* hotel as mentioned on Expedia. Its close to US consulate but with rooms so bad I would rather travel a few minutes then stay here.
4554,Hilton Chennai,A relaxing Break from the streets of Chennai,"The Hilton Chennai, is a lovely hotel with very kind staff and extremely clean and relaxing rooms. Q-bar on the roof is always hopping on Friday and Saturday nights and the food at the restaurant or room service will help any western travelers belly from getting delhi belly. Just wear your bug spray in the lobby from the mosquitos they are many."

4561,Hilton Chennai,,am enjoyed
4562,Nayagara,Good Hotel for Business or Relaxed trip,"It's a good and clean hotel with great hospitality and convenient location, I recommend this hotel. It is value for money. In terms of improvement, they can add traditional South Indian breakfast items on their breakfast buffet menu other than only Idly and Dosa."
4563,Harrisons Chennai,Good value,"The physical facilities are quite nice - large clean room, comfortable lobby - but little things detract. The safe malfunctioned the day before I left, the WiFi bandwidth was overly maxed out during evenings making email impossible, the fitness room was a joke."
4564,Deccan Plaza,"Nice location, close to Marina beach","It's a decent hotel located close to Marina beach and a few good restaurants, very friendly staff."
4565,Novotel Chennai Sipcot,New Hotel,Functional. were at hotel during a very quire period so don't have experience of service during busy times.

4603,Aadithya,Good one,"Good one & its a beautiful place with a stunning view of the lake. The zoo, china peak, lakes around Bhimtal such as Naukuchiatal etc are nearby. The real beauty of the lake can be felt if you are at any of the hilltop resort, with the reflection of lights into the lakes nearby!!"
4604,Hyatt Regency Chennai,Won't get back to this hotel,"Hotel is not a 5 starts hotel anymore.
The neighborhood is in construction so you can't get out by walking.
The hotel has a ballroom so they have parties every night and you can hear it in the room (7th floor).

The free WI-Fi is lousy"

4613,Aloft Chennai Omr - It Expressway,Great stay with nice location,Aloft is near the global hospital where we were admitted a relative and we stayed here for a night.

Bar is available. Spacious rooms. On the total, it is value for money."
4616,Star City Serviced Apartments,Worst hotel service,"Worst hotel and breakfast, dirty blankets and towels, they do not care to change even after complaining. The reception person do not understand and even cannot speak either english or hindi. Booked a taxi through them, they send a taxi with driver who could not understand or speak english or hindi, so for whole day I was travelling with driver, who could not understand what I was saying and I could not understand what he was saying."

4701,The Park Chennai,Over rated and overpriced Hotel,I am not sure why someone wants to spend that kind of money to be disappointed.
4702,Peace Inn,Nice Beach Hotel,"I visited Chennai in the summer of 2014. This hotel is nice! It has high speed fans, A/C, & a useable bathroom.  My room was clean! Considering the price & location, this was a pleasant stay. The rooftop restaurant provides a kind service and tasty food! For mosquitoes, I suggest using repellant anywhere you go."
