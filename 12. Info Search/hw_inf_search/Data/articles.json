We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

The study and\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function.

To\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices).

With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)).

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 16:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 19:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 19:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 15:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-22","authors_parsed":[["Mulmuley","Ketan D.",""]]}

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 20:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Randall","Scott W.",""],["Markevitch","Maxim",""],["Clowe","Douglas",""],["Gonzalez","Anthony H.",""],["Bradac","Marusa",""]]}

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr.

The survey allows us to investigate six\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 09:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Fornasier","S.",""],["Dotto","E.",""],["Hainaut","O.",""],["Marzari","F.",""],["Boehnhardt","H.",""],["De Luise","F.",""],["Barucci","M.

We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 11:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Szollosi","Gergely J",""],["Derenyi","Imre",""]]}

In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and\ndirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for\nSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2007 14:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29","authors_parsed":[["Kang","W.",""],["Williams","R.

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O.

We incorporate a new method for including the\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 00:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Smith","Britton D.",""],["Sigurdsson","Steinn",""]]}

The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3.

The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk.

It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%.

Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days.

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 11:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2007 14:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 22:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 01:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2007 05:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Chkareuli","J.

Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement.

We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak.

The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages.

The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,\nboth over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.\n  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons\nseparating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of\naveraging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging\nresults. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem\nfor smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 09:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Wright","Paul",""]]}

The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate).

Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD.

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data.

Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters.

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral.

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 21:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Kar","Soummya",""],["Moura","Jose M.
